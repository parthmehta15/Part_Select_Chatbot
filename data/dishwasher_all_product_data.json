If the impeller in the dishwasher is damaged or the motor has been shorted out and will not drain, it is possible the body is cracked, causing leakage. To prevent this from happening, replace the drain pump. The tools needed for this installation are: Phillips screwdriver, 5/16 inch nut driver, 5/8 inch wrench, and a flathead screwdriver. Remember to unplug your dishwasher from the power source before beginning this installation project. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further installation instructions.\n",

      "Having trouble with the dishwasher draining. I replaced the drain pump 30 days ago and it worked fine. Now i have the same issue, it will not drain. It will drain if you \"force\" it to drain by holding down the start button for 3 seconds, but you have to repeat that 4 times to get it to fully drain. Any thoughts?Hi Doug,\n\nThank you for your question.  There are a few parts that could cause the issue. It seems like your problem is that it will not drain automatically. I would suggest checking your door latch switches just to make sure they are working. If they are not the machine may think the door is open and will not go into the automatic drain cycle. However, if that part is working then it may be your control board that is the issue. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Should the sump be drained completely at the end of the full cycle?  When our dishwasher is done there is an inch or so of water in the bottom of the sump.  Thank you!Hello Rick, thank you for your question. The If there is water left over at the end of the cycle, I would suggest checking the water inlet valve to be sure its not leaking into the unit, the float switch and the drain pump itself. Also check the drain hose, to be sure there are no blockages preventing all the water from being pushed out of the unit. I hope this helps!",
      "After replacing the drain pump motor on my Kitchenaid dishwasher it still will not drain. Do you have any suggestions?Hello Kristin,\n\nThanks for your question. It may be worth checking the motor and pump assembly and seeing if there is any blockage in the drain line. If the motor does not run during the drain cycle, or if it simply hums instead of running, it may need to be replaced. Also check the drain hoses to see if they are clogged. Lastly, look at the sump pump check valve. If it is stuck closed it will keep the water from draining. Clean that out and replace it if it is necessary.\n\nI hope this helps.",
      "The drain pump was replaced 2 years ago. Bit by bit, the dishwasher has not been draining totally. It has become so bad that it needs to be pumped 10 or more times before it is totally drained. We have checked the pump that was replaced and it appears fine. We have checked all of the lines from the food disposer, no obstructions or kinks. What should be the next move?Thank you.Hello Karen, thank you for inquiring. For this symptom, besides the Drain Pump part PS11753379, you may want to replace either the Drain Hose part PS2358130, the Filter part PS11759673, or the Turbidity Sensor part PS11757214. We hope this helps.",
      "The dishwasher has a small amount of visible water remaining around the drain after the washer is run. Do you think the drain pump is bad or is there something else to trouble shoot?Hi Buddy,\nThank you for your inquiry.  If the dishwasher is not draining the drain pump is just one part you will need to check. There are some other parts that you will need to check also to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the sump pump check valve, the drain hose, the water inlet valve, the chopper assembly, the bi metal fuse, the circulation pump and motor, the float switch and the turbidity sensor.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "Hi, my dishwasher is not draining; after all cycles are finished, there is still water at the bottom of the dishwasher. Other symptom: Sometimes, the clean led would blink 7 times, then repeats; so i have to reset the dishwasher. Also the dishes are not very clean at the end of all cycles; i would say half clean only. I first ordered from you and replaced the drain pump but problem was still there. Then the clean led blinking 7 times was pointing to a heating problem so i replaced the bi-metal fuse and heating elements. But problem is still there. I could notice during washing cycle that it would stop for a long time doing nothing. Anything else i could check? I am out of ideas and about to replace the whole thing after spending time and money on parts.Hello Sylvain, Thank you for the question. I suggest checking the Turbidity Sensor, PartSelect Number PS11757214. If you disconnect power from the dishwasher, you can test the turbidity sensor at connection P12 of the control board. From pin 1 to pin 3, you should get a resistance reading between 46 to 52 K Ohms. If the resistance is not within this range, then you will need to replace the sensor. Hope this helps!",
      "I have a Kenmore elite dishwasher the washer getting water, heater works water hot, it drains, i does not start it cycle. I have to push cancel and the water drains. Help thanks mikeHello Mike, Thank you for the question. This sounds like the Electronic Control Board is not sending the appliance through the cycles and the Electronic Control Board will need to be replaced. Hope this helps!",

      "I think it may be the solenoid on the pump, there's a clicking sound  that comes from the pump .I  remove the hose an inspected the the impeller on the pump its fine and it turns . Cleaned the strainer and check the check valve   thanksHi Robert,\nThank you for contacting us.  If you are getting a clicking noise from the drain pump it maybe that the the electronic control board is not send the proper voltage to it.  I would use a multimeter to check the continuity of both parts to see which one is causing the issue.  I hope this helps with the repair.",
      "Everything seems to be working fine, but the dishes come out smelly. The odor from the steam and open door is very smelly. What will help this problem?Hi Sandra,\n\nThank you for your question. It could be your drain pump. I would actually suggest getting some dishwasher cleaner and running it through a cycle in your machine. You may also want to check the water hose that is coming from your house to the appliance. I would say try those things first, maybe go through a couple of cleaning cycles with a dishwasher cleaner. Finish is usually a very good brand. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

If the dishwasher is stopping in the middle of a cycle, the issue may be  caused by either the door latch, the electronic control board or the heating element.  Check to see if you have an adequate water supply.  If you are not getting a good supply of water, this could cause the dishwasher not to work properly. Also, if you are overloading the dishwasher this may prevent it from cleaning properly and cause it to shut down.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",

      "Dishwasher goes through all the cycles but the heating element dose not work  had the heating element and the thermostat checked out both are goodHello Melvin, thank you for your question. Check your dishwasher cycle settings. You may have to turn on heated dry. Quick-wash or express wash settings do not include the heated dry cycle to conserve time, meaning you are likelier to have wet dishes when using one of these speedier settings. Inspect the rinse aid dispenser. Energy efficient dishwashers depend on rinse aid for optimal performance. Pour in enough rinse aid until the indicator shows it is full. If there is already enough rinse aid in the dispenser, a buildup of gunk could be preventing the rinse aid from dispensing into the machine during the rinse cycle. To clean the rinse aid dispenser, remove the cap, then set a dishwasher-safe bowl filled with two cups of white vinegar on the top rack of your otherwise-empty dishwasher. Leave the rinse aid dispenser cap off, and run the appliance on the hottest water setting. If these solutions do not solve the problem, it could be the rubber washer, part number PS11743934. We hope this helps. Good luck with your repair."

      "How can i tell if it’s broken? There’s a tab inside the top circle that looks like it’s pushed in. How does the tube connect? Does it connect to the top circle or the bottom one?Hi Kristen,\nThank you for your question.  Before you begin any repair please unplug the appliance from the electrical outlet or turn the circuit breaker off.  Then slide the upper dishrack out of the tracks and then remove the bottom dishrack.  Detach the water supply tube assembly from the mounting bracket assembly on the top and the rear of the tub.  Rotate the old water supply tube to release it from the pump assembly.  Prepare the new water supply tube for installation by transferring the upper wash arm from the old tube to the new one.  To do this rotate the locking ring clockwise to release the arm.  Remove the locking ring and position it on the new wash arm support with the flat side facing the connector.  Align the wash arm on the support and rotate the locking ring counter-clockwise to secure the arm.  Now insert the bottom of the new water supply tube into the pump assembly and rotate the tube to secure.  Snap the new tube into the mounting brackets on the rear and the top of the tub.  Replace the lower dishrack and reposition the upper dishrack onto the track.  Your dishwasher is now ready to use again.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

They do press in rather hard though, so you have to use a bit of force to get them to snap in place. Follow these steps for step-by-step instructions:\n1: To replace the control cover on your dishwasher, you will need to pull the appliance a few inches away from the cabinet in order to fully remove the door.\n2: Use a quarter-inch socket or nut driver to remove the screws securing the lower access panel.\n3: Remove the panel along with any insulation and determine if the power line and water supply line have enough slack to move the dishwasher.\n4: Remove the panel along with any insulation and determine if the power line and water supply line have enough slack to move the dishwasher.\n5: If not, you will need to shut off the water supply valve then use channel–lock pliers to help unthread the water supply line fitting from the inlet valve to be prepared for some water to spill.\n5: Next, use a 5/16th inch socket or nut driver to unthread the screw, securing the junction box cover. Then pull the cover off.\n6: Unthread the strain relief nut and detach the strain relief from the junction box.\n7: Next, disconnect the drain hose from the sink or garbage disposer and feed it through the cabinet.\n8: Open the dishwasher door and remove the mounting bracket screws.\n9: Unhook both door cables from the hinges.\n10: Disconnect the door wire connecter and detach the wires from the retainer.\n11: Now open the door and lift up to remove it from the hinge supports.\n12: Use the quarter-inch socket or nut driver to unthread the two lower screws securing the hinges.\n13: Slide the hinges out.\n14: Now remove the upper screws securing the inner door panel to the outer panel.\n15: Slide the inner panel up to detach it. If still intact, lift the old control cover up and push forward to remove.\n16: Install the new control cover by aligning the cover tabs with the slots in the inner panel, then snap the cover into place.\n17: With the control cover installed, realign the tabs on the inner panel with the slots on the outer panel and slide the inner panel down.\n18: Replace the screws to secure the two panels.\n19: Reposition both door hinges on the support rails and replaces the screws to secure.\n20: Reinstall the door by aligning the hinge pins in the hinge supports.\n21: Close the door, then reconnect the door wire connecter and secure the wires in the retainer.\n22: Hook both door cables onto the hinges. Connect the wires using the wire nuts.\n23: Align the cover and replace the screw to secure. Reconnect the water supply line to the inlet valve.\n24: Replace any insulation then reposition the lower access panel. Secure it with the screws.\n25: With the repair completed, turn the water supply back on as well as the power and your dishwasher should be ready for use.\nWe hope that helps!"

      "The handle on our dishwasher can get stuck when grabbed to open the door.  At this point we can still push it back into place and get it to open.  I'm not sure what part needs to be replaced?  Is it door latch actuator, door handle, door release spring or door latch bracket?  Any ideas?  Thank you!!Hello Kornelia, thank you for your question. It could be any of those parts. We usually recommend disassembling the control panel and latch to see what the issue is, and order accordingly, or order all the above mentioned parts and return anything that isn't used. Its hard to say what the issue is without seeing what is going on. The most likely issue is the Part Number: PS11745495 handle and the Part Number: PS886319 bracket. I hope this helps!",
      "What does the door actuator do?Hi Rick,\n\nThank you for your question. The actuator releases your door latch so that you can open your door when you pull on your handle. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Should I order this latch if:  I close the door and push the start button... it flashes.  then i apply a little pressure to the door (just below the buttons) and the dishwasher runs.  but when i release the pressure, the dishwasher stops and the start button flashes.  what do you think?Hi Katharine, Thank you for your question. It could be this part. It is a physical part so if you take a look at your actuator and see that it is broken, it would be this part. You  may also want to take a quick  test of your micro switches as well. You can do that with a multi meter by doing a continuity test. These switches should test 0 ohms to be working. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Left house so pulled handle up to shut off dishwasher. Returned and it would not start.  Repair man said i had a broken latch. Ordered it. Not the problem. The switch actuator is not touching the white points.  Do you think this is the problem or any suggestions?  After two phone calls, the repair man did not come. Trying to do this myself.Hi Betty,\nThank you for your question.  The switch could be the issue.  This dishwasher door switch will shut your dishwasher off when the door is opened.  There are some other parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the bi-metal fuse, the electronic control board, the heating element, the circulation pump, and the high limit thermostat.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "All the lights are on, I press the normal wash, it starts blinking, I close the door and push start and nothing. The lights for in the middle section has no lights. I've replaced the bi-metal fuse based on all the q&a, but that wasn't the cure. I also just noticed that the soap dispenser did not dispense. The door latch seems to have many components. Is it the actuator? As there's no clicking sound when I engage the door to open or close. It closes fine though. If I have to buy several components for the door latch, all plastic, at $30+ each, I might as well go to dent and scratch and buy a new one. pls help.Hello Grace, Thank you for the question. Before replacing parts we suggest opening up the panel and checking the parts to the latch for damage. If they are defective it will show visible damage or wear. You can also test the Door Switch, If there is no continuity the part should be replaced. We hope this helps!",
      "clean lite on consol keeps blinking 8 times over an overHello Gerard, thank you for the great question. We have found that the clean light blinking eight times means that the dishwasher cannot fill up with water properly. We recommend you check the water pressure and make sure the water tubing is not clogged and make sure the float device in the front right corner of the tub is not stuck in the up position. If the water pressure is moderate and the tubing is not clogged, you will need to replace the water inlet valve, part number PS8760080, to fix the issue. Good luck with this repair!"

You can also check the small holes in the arm to see if they are blocked. If there is a blockage the water can not build up enough pressure to spin the Spray Arm. Hope this helps, good luck with this repair!"

Is the problem the touchpad or the electronic control board?Hi John,\n\nThank you for your question. It seems like it would more likely be an issue with your touchpad. You can test that part though. Removing it from your board. Test the ribbon terminals between 6 and 10 with a multi meter. There will be a little arrow or indicator on one side of the ribbon to let you know which one starts as terminal 1. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",

      "Thank you for the opportunity to discuss my problem.  My dishwasher has leaked on two occasions.  I first replaced the door seal with success!  Thank you for the video showing how to do this.  The seal was expensive at $110 cdn dollars.  Wow.  Now i have a second leak at the bottom of the door.  It seems to be coming from the middle of the door.  I have taken the inside panel off and now plan on replacing the foam seal as instructed on your video.  However, i am concerned that the leak might actually be the plastic panel at the bottom as it seems to be pulling apart at both ends.  I am wondering if the plastic panel can be replaced and what that part number would be?  Thank youHello Denis and thank you for writing.\nThe inner seal foam should do the trick, however, we would like to look into the matter of the toe panel, but we do require your full model and serial number to do this correctly, so if you could please supply us with that information you would be very happy to look into this for you.  We hope this helps. Please contact us anytime."

      "I am trying to replace the heater on a Bosch dishwasher    is it located right below the center of the unit     which panels do i have to take of to make change   i have the left side panel (facing unit) off but cannot see part i want to replace   need help with process thanxHi Rick, \n\nThank you for your question. This installation is an intermediate level installation. You will have to shut the water and the power off to your appliance. You will have to remove the kickplate/access panel at the bottom of your appliance. Then the outer door panel. After that you will have to remove the bracket that would be just behind the kickplate. Once you have all that removed, you will have to remove your lower rack, and your filter and manifold from inside of the dishwasher. Once you have those parts uninstalled, remove the mounting brackets of your appliance and remove the appliance from underneath the counter. You will then gently place it on it's back. This will give you access to the bottom of the appliance. Remove the hose going to the water inlet valve. After that remove your drain pump and sump assembly from underneath your dishwasher. This is where your heater assembly is located. Unplug it from the wiring harness and then reinstall the new part by following these steps backwards. If you are uncomfortable with this installation, I would suggest contacting a certified technician to help you out. Good luck with your repair.",

      "How do I remove the dishwasher door cover to access the blower motor. I have 4 phillips head screws on both sides and 4 at the top. And none at the bottom. I have seen videos of other models but not mine. It is the stainless steel model with control pad on very top part of door. Not visible looking straight on. Thank you. I'm hoping it is just those 12 screws because if this gets too complicated I wont order the part and will call the expensive GE repair guy. I like to think I can safely do this though, with the power breaker switched off. Have replaced ice maker and valves on the fridge last year. With no problem.Hi Mark, Thank you for the question. Looking at the diagrams and the parts, you should be able to remove the panels by removing the 12 screws. Hope this helps!",
      "Won't start. Has power. Only \"delay hrs\" and \"steam\" buttons work on op panel. Tried power off reset, no change. Metered door switch on door latch, checked OK. Can't make any change in symptoms. \nAny ideas would be appreciated. ThanksHello Gary, Thank you for the question. This could be an indication the Console is faulty and may need to be replaced. We also suggest checking the wiring connections for damage or a lose wire. If you need help placing an order, customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you!"

Is it possible that the switch is now no longer functioning and needs to be replaced before the refrigerator will resume cooling?Hi Michael, thank you for your inquiry. Based on our research, a refrigerator door switch controls the on/off function of the interior lights with the opening or closing of the door. It does not have an effect on cooling. To solve this issue, you may need to check the start relay, part number PS963826, as it is most likely faulty and may need to be replaced. Glad to be of assistance!",

You will have to remove all of the screws holding the inner door panel to the outer door panel. You should then be able to pop off your old latch. If the wire harness is hard to remove from your latch you can use a flat head screw driver to help push the plugs off of the old terminals. Make sure to replace your handle as this part does not come with your handle already attached. After you have done that, just follow these steps in reverse to put your appliance back together.

      "Good day! I have already pulled the pump out and your video nails the process and your pricing is very competitive (especially for those of us in Canada). I was wondering however if you are able to confirm that this is the part I need to replace. Our dishwasher was leaking and upon inspection, the water was coming from the pump area and must have had a slow leak for some time as the spring clamp has some rust on it. Once I removed the dishwasher and was able to look a bit better, the water seems to be coming out of a hole found up in what looks like vents (5 rectangular openings in the pump body right outside of the inserted portion.) I can dump a container of water into the dishwasher and it comes out of this hole without the dishwasher even running (or plugged in.) I don't want to replace an expensive part such as this if it's not the issue. Appreciate any thoughts. Thanks in advance.Hello Corey, Thank you for the question. With the information provided it does sound like the pump is damaged and will need to be replaced. Thank you for your inquiry, good luck with this repair!",

The PF code stands for power failure and will appear when the power has been interrupted to the unit. To clear this, press the START/CANCEL button. If this does not clear the code and resolve the issue, then you will need to replace the Electronic Control Board part PS234516 for your model. We hope this helps.",

If you find that there is nothing clogging the tubing and wash parts, then I would suggest taking a look at your pump being the issue. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",

      "Our LG dishwasher leaks at the bottom of the door on the left side. I recently replaced the rubber door gasket but still has this issue.  Also it seems to drain very slowly and noticed a lot of water inside bottom when in the middle of the cycle. Should there be any buildup of water in the inside bottom should this always drain right away?  Thanks!Hi Dave, Thank you for the question.You shoudl not have a noticeable amount of water at the bottom of the tub. It sounds like the appliance is over filling. Once the fill cycle is done, open the door and look to see if the water level is under the heat element. Hope this helps!",

Le code d'erreur OE indique un problème avec le système de vidange. Si le tuyau n'est pas bouché ou plié, vous devez vérifier la présence de bouchons ou de débris dans la pompe de vidange. Si la pompe est dégagée, la pompe devra être remplacée. J'espère que cela aide!",

This is a safety mechanism to ensure that there are no unsafe buildups of gas inside your appliance. The coils are attached to the dryer gas valve. If the dryer does not heat or heats intermittently, the coil may not be opening the gas valve. Both coils must be operational for the valve to open. No continuity would indicate a defective coil, but they can be intermittent and fail when they get hot. Both coils should be replaced when one of them is broken. This part can break as a result of material fatigue from normal use. This part measures approximately 1 inch in diameter and 1 inch in height, and is constructed of plastic and metal.

      "If the flame in my dryer is only lasting for a few seconds and then shutting off is it the igniters problem? What should I be looking for in this situation?Hi Kaelyn, Thank you for the question. The coils can be tested using a multi-meter tool. The 2-prong coil read 1,000-1,300 ohms. The 3-prong coil will read 1,300-1,400 ohms across prongs 1 and 2, and 500-600 ohms across prongs 1 and 3. Please let us know if you have any further questions!",
      "I’m having problems with my dryer because I don’t think there is any gas but the igniter is coming on. Would the gas valve coil kit solve thisHi Joelle, yes this should fix your problem. Unfortunately, there is no real way to test which coil is the problem so both should be replaced at the same time, which is why this assembly will come with 2. I hope this helps!",

      "I think my coils need replacing because I am not getting heat in my dryer… but how do I check the igniter, where is it? Id rather wait to buy this part and make sure that I actually need it!Hello Olie, we suggest removing the front panel and the drum, and then turn the dryer on. When the dryer turns on, pay attention to the igniter and see what it does. Best of luck with this repair.",
      "Hello when i turn on my clothe dryer i notice that my gas valve opens only once in the first start then the igniter turns on normaly but not the gas valve no flames at all i then turn off the dryer wait a few minutes and it ignites Flame once and again same problem the igniter turns red hot at its normal phase but no Flame what could it be thank youHi David,\n\nThank you for your question. There are a few parts that might cause this problem, however you should check your Radiant Flame Sensor to see if it is malfunctioning. This part senses heat from the igniter to monitor if it is hot enough to ignite gas to light the burner. Once the igniter is hot enough it will open the valve and allow gas to flow. This is a safety mechanism to prevent dangerous levels of gas from building up. \n\nI hope that helps!",
      "I replaced the thermostat but now i want to replace the coils.  But i see nothing on videos or manuals that shows me where they are.  Can you give me direction?Hi Fred,\n\nThank you for your inquiry. The coils are located on the bottom left hand front corner of your appliance. You will have to remove the front panel of your appliance to be able to get to it. Good luck with your repair.",
      "I just took out the coils from my older Maytag gas drier. I took ohm readings with my fluke meter. Both are reading zero resistance. Does this mean they are bad?Hi Mark,\n\nThank you for your question. The coils should be reading a resistance of 1000 - 2000 ohms. If it is zero, then your coils are bad. Good luck with your repair.",
      "The igniter will glow, then the Flame comes on for about 10 seconds, then Flame and igniter will turn off. After about a minute that's off, the igniter will turn on again and the Flame will follow soon after but the Flame again will only stay for about 10 sec. And this cycle keep repeating. What could be the problem part?Hi Ramon. Thank you for the question. I suggest replacing or testing the Radiant Flame Sensor.If you test it with a Multi Meter it shoudl read closed. Hope this helps!",
      "Dryer heats the first time.  After that i hear a rattling sound and the ignitor glows, no gas to ignite so ignitor shuts down.  The process repeats but no heat.   Let the dryer sit idle for a while and it will heat again once or twice..   coils?Hello Arnie, Thank you for your inquiry. Yes, that would be the part we would recommend replacing first. Hope this helps!",
      "I've been having problems with my timer advancing, and my heating doesn't turn on all the time.Could the coils for the gas be causing this?Hi Larry, Thank you for the question. The 'M' Series New Style Coil Kit does work in line with the timer. I suggest replacing the coils first and if they do not fix the issue you may need to replace the timer. Hope this helps!"

      "Dishwasher smells badly/ i cleaned filters, arms used baking soda, lemon juice, etc.What's next?Hi Barry,\nThank you for your question.  If your dishwasher still smells bad inside after a good cleaning, check the hoses to see if they are kinked or clogged.  If they are clean them out and position them correctly as outlined in your owner's manual. If you have't tried it, use vinegar.  Place 1 cup of vinegar into a bowl and set in on the upper rack of your dishwasher.  Close the door and run the dishwasher with the hottest setting.  Run the hot water in the kitchen sink for a few minutes before turning the dishwasher on so that the water is good and hot.  The dishwasher should be empty except for the bowl when you do this.  Once the cycle is complete, remove the bowl and leave the door open, so the dishwasher can dry out.  We hope this helps!  Good luck with the repair!",

      "My dishwasher will no longer shut. The repectle on the back of the door for the latch wont allow the latch to enter. Is this the correct part to replace in this case?Hi Deidra, thank you for your question. If that is the part that is broken on your door latch then yes. You should be able to see which piece is broken as these are physical parts for the most part and not electrical. If you are not sure I would suggest just taking a deeper look at the parts to see if you notice any damage to be sure. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Why is my dishwasher staying on rise only modeHello Tyrone, thank you for contacting us. Try unplugging the dishwasher or turning the breaker off for 60 seconds to reset the machine. If this does not solve the problem, you will need to replace the touch pad which is sold on the Escutcheon Assembly part PS2370581. We hope this helps.",
      "My GE profile quietpower 4 latch is wobbly in its place and will not allow the door to dishwasher to be opened. I don't have any space between top of dishwasher and bottom of countertop   so i cannot even jiggle a thin and long allen wrench in the space. I was try to see if i snap the latch through the underside of latch, but that doesn't work either. I cannot seem to pull the dishwasher either. Help?!Hello Lucy, thank you for your question. To access that area you should open the door and unscrew the mounting plates from the counter top and pull the dishwasher out of its space a bit to access the latch area. You will want to check the Door Handle Actuator Part #: PS2337860, Retainer Handle - Black Part #: PS958991, Recess Door Spring Part #: PS285013, and latch handle Part #: PS259297. I hope this helps!",
      "Hi, our dishwasher can be closed, but can not be opened normally. While it is close, we can't press start either.We have now select \"spring plunger\", \"door handle actuator\", \"switch interlock assembly\" as possible part broken. \nhow can we test and determine which part should we change?\n\nthanks!Hello Min-Lee, thank you for inquiring. You can test the Interlock Switch Assembly, part number PS783632 for your model, with a multi-meter for continuity. With the switch pressed down, it should test as 0 ohms of resistance to have continuity. Otherwise it is faulty and will need to be replaced. Good luck with your repair!",
      "Door will not open after cleaning.  How do i open it?  Latch seems broken.Hi Marie,\nThank you for your inquiry.  It sounds like you have to replace the the door latch.  To open the door you may have to unplug the dishwasher for a few minutes and plug it back in to see if that will allow the door to open.  If you have any issues you will need to consult your owners manual.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

      "My dishwasher will not light up or start after it is closedHi Roger, thank you for your inquiry. First, you need to check the door latch, part number PS16218716, because the door latch makes sure that the door is securely shut. When it malfunctions, your dishwasher won’t work properly. If it is fine, then you may need to check the dishwasher user interface control button assembly, part number PS12585991. We hope this sorts out your problem!",
      "keep says code cdHello Billie, thank you for reaching out. The error code CD means that the dishwasher does not think the door is shut. If you have opened and closed the door firmly and you still get the error, your door latch assembly, part number PS16218716, needs to be replaced. There are switches built into the latch and they are not sending a good signal to the main control board to tell it that the door is shut, so even if the door is closing properly, the dishwasher will not run. We hope this information helps!",
      "Door Lach do not release when the cycle endsHello Raul, thank you for your inquiry. According to our understanding, the issue is most probably with the door latch, part number PS16218716. You may need to replace it to fix the issue. We hope this helps!",
      "The connector s that where connected to door latch look burned up how do I fix thisHello Anthony, Thank you for your inquiry. The connectors would be part of the wiring harness PS11703843. We hope this helps and if you need help placing an order for a part, customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you!",
      "Would this latch (#530425218) be compatible with my Electrolux dishwasher (Model #FFID2426TS5A)?Hello John, We are glad you asked! Yes, the Latch PS16218716 you had chosen is compatible with your model. We are pleased to have been able to help."

      "I bought and installed your kit.  After the Test/calibration mode I was able to run the dishwasher once.  It will not start.  I've turned the power off for an hour and when I turn it back on the Clean light blinks.  The Options and Cycle lites have not worked following installation.  It appears the circuit boards are faulty.  Can you offer some advice?Hi Gerald, thank you for reaching out. Based on the description that you have provided, we would recommend checking the interlock switch, part number PS1021382, and check the control tactile assembly kit, part number PS4704220, for continuity. To test the control board properly, touch the multimeter probes to the test points present on the board. Make sure while doing this step that you have your hands on the plastic portion of the probes. You can then go on to check either the voltage or resistance. When measuring the resistors’ resistance, connect one probe to the end of each resistor. We hope this solves your problem!",

How else can i troubleshoot that this motor is not working? What is your return policy if i purchase this motor?Hello Martin and thanks for writing.\nNot enough pressure could be from your water inlet valve # PS9865067 if that is faulty or debris stuck in it could cause your spray arms to malfunction. In some cases, if the water pressure coming into your house is low that can be a problem. So we would suggest checking the water valve first before moving on to the motor. You can check that part with an ohmmeter.\n\n Apparently there is a difference between the “Drain Pump” and the “Drain Motor”. Drain Motor Resistance should be between 20 - 40 Ohms. (Drain Motor, attached to the sump pump, is larger.)\n.    We hope this helps. Please contact us anytime.",

      "Washer is smoking during spin operation,and i am finding plastic pc's in the drain pump clean out was wondering 8f plastic pc's could be coming off the inside of the pump everything is working but something is smokingHi Gerald,\nThank you for your inquiry.  If your washer is smoking during the spin cycle there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the belt, the motor pulley, the drain pump, the direct drive motor coupling, the clutch assembly and the drive motor.  Also if you have plastic pieces showing up in your pump it is likely that the drum bearing is worn out or the support for the basket is worn out causing the spin basket to wobble and rub into the front half of the outer tub and you will need to check this out.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",

On one occasion i pressed the pump access door and the noise subsided. Could it be the drain pump that needs replacing?Hello Satish, Thank you for your inquiry. Possibly, but I would also check the pump access shroud, pump service channel, pump access door and service panel that they attach to in order make sure those parts are not loose as if they were, they could be vibrating during the rinse cycle and causing the noise. You can test the motor and drain pump with a multimeter to see if it is functioning properly. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, there are YouTube videos available to assist you. Hope this helps!",

Checking out the following parts may help you get to the root of the problem: the drain pump filter, part number PS16874133, the drain hose, part number PS1022525, and the drain pump, part number PS1766031.

      "My washer finished a heavy load cycle but got very loud at the end of spinning. The loud spinning sound happened before so I let it keep on going. When it stopped, I went over to take out the laundry. There was strong rubbery smell, and smoke came out of the top of door as soon as I opened it. Checked drive belt on the back, it was fine. Please advise what was wrong with the washer? I like the matching w&d set and would like to repair it if possible. Thank you!Hi Louisa, thank you for the question. Based on our understanding of the issue, we would suggest you check the drive motor, part number PS1020369. Adding too many clothes to your washing machine can stress the motor, causing it to overheat or malfunction and emit a burning smell. Also, the drive motor bearings might be worn out, resulting in a loud noise during operation. If this part is faulty, you may need to replace it. We hope this helps!"

If the water line from the water inlet valve to the ice maker was frozen, you will need to verify if these 2 parts are working correctly as the components of these parts may have been damaged.  You should also check the fill tubes and the cycling thermostat.  We have included a link that you may reference on how to check some of these parts.  Once you have determined the part you need, please feel free to call customer service.  We are open 7 days a week and anyone will be happy to assist you.  We look forward to hearing from you!",

What do i do, they are led lights.Hello Jo and thank you for writing.\nAs they all quit working at the same time it certainly sounds like a faulty  LED emitter control board PS1173809 you should check for signs of damage, and replace it if needed.   We hope this helps. Please contact us anytime.",

For your convenience, we have attached the link to our repair video (not sure if you seen this one). We hope this helps. Good luck with your repair\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7QQ8Y97Fog&feature=emb_title",
      "Does the light switch on the freezer side have anything to do with water and ice dispensing?  Light works, freezer works, filter replaced, dispensing control board replaced, but still not dispensing water or ice.  ThanksHello Ken,\nThank you for your question. Our sources do not show any correlation with the light switch affecting the ice and water dispenser, but if the water filter has already been replaced, we suggest replacing the water inlet valve under part PS2069865 for your model to fix the dispenser issues. We hope this helps.",
      "Will not dispense water or make ice WRF989SDAM02Hello Guy and thanks for writing.\nIf the refrigerator ice maker is not working the water filter might be clogged. Try changing the water filter. If the ice maker is not working the icemaker mold thermostat might be defective. Inside the control module of the ice maker is a thermostat that monitors the temperature of the ice mold (ice tray).  We hope this helps. Please contact us at any time"

      "Ok,the dispenser door not always opened during the wash the upper rack was not getting clean, so I am thinking the upper arm needs to be replaced.There is not an option to order the middle spray arm.

There is a wax motor on the back of the dispenser that opens the dispenser door. The motor is not sold on its own so the dispenser will need to be replaced, PartSelect Number PS3655072. Hope this helps!"

Is it normally on a timer?Don't think it needs to be replacedHello Josephine, Thank you for the question. If the pod is placed in the bottom of the tub, it will be washed away before the wash cycle can start during the fill cycle. The dispenser releases it at a certain time during the cycle after the tub fills and water is circulating in order for it to do its job, other wise the dishes will not be cleaned properly. Hope this helps, good luck with this repair!"

Is there something else wrong or that should be checked?Hello William, Thank you for your inquiry. We have researched the model number you have provided and it could be an issue with the wiring or with the dishwasher timer, which can cause the solenoid to stay powered up for too long and overheat. Check the wires for any visible damage, and check the timer with a multimeter. We hope this helps and if you need help placing an order, customer service is open 7 days a week.

      "I tested the ohms on my dishwasher solonoid and it read 36...does that mean it is working and doesnt need to be replaced? and if so, how do i know/test if it is the sump that needs to be replaced?Hi Anell,\nThank you for your question.  When your multi-meter is set the R x 1 setting, place each of the meter's probes on one terminal each. When the probes touch the terminals, the reading should change from a reading of infinity to a reading of approximately 40 ohms. If you receive a reading of infinity, or a reading that is no where near 40 ohms, then you will need to replace the solenoid.  Where the reading is near 40 ohms the drain solenoid and bracket assembly should be fine.  We hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day.",

You will need a Allen Wrench to remove the Set Screws. We hope this helps, good luck with the repair!",

      "Will replacing the timer fix the problem of the timer stopping in the middle of the dishwasher cycle and not continuing to complete the cycle?Hi Louis,\nThank you for your question.  If the timer is stopping mid-cycle, there may be an issue with the heating element.  If the heating element malfunctions, this will sometimes cause the dishwasher to stop mid-cycle.  To test the element, set your multi-meter to Rx1 and touch each probe to a terminal. Your reading should be somewhere between zero and infinity, refer to your owner’s manual to determine what reading you should receive for your model. If it is exactly zero or infinity it is defective. If your test produces a reading different from the manufacturer’s recommendation, you will need a replacement heating element. If the element is fine then check the timer.  Set your multi-meter to Rx1000 and touch the contacts with the probes. Most functioning timers will fall in the range of 2000-3500 ohms of resistance, but this varies between models. Refer to your owner's manual to determine what reading your test should produce. If your test results differ from the manufacturer's recommendations, you will need a replacement timer. We hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day.",
      "Not sure what is broke, but the issue is dishwasher runs, but the selector will not move on it's own. All cycles will work if I move the selector but again it doesn't move without me turning the dial. I suspect it's the timer but don't want to purchase it unless that is the part I need. Can you tell me if my thought is correct or not and if I'm wrong what you think the issue is and what part I need to order?Hello Kevin, thank you for contacting us. It seems like there is a problem with your dishwasher timer, part number PS4704218. The timer manages the various dishwasher functions such as filling, washing, draining and drying and it is responsible for cycle selection. We hope that helps!",

      "Have this in basement, hooked up to cold (testing to see if unit works).  Did a cycle no problem but when I started another and came back in the morning, it was still going?  Timer issue or should it be hooked up to hot water, for it to function properly?Hi Mark,\nThank you for your question.  There is a delayed hour button on your dishwasher where you can delay a cycle for 2, 4, or 8 hours.  If this button was pressed a couple of times, this may be the reason the dishwasher washer was still running.  If this was not the issue, you can try installing it to the hot water to see if this helps, if not you may need to replace the timer.  If you have any questions, please let us know.  We are open 7 days a week.  We look forward to hearing from you!",
      "Started dishwasher 8pm was still running 6:30 the next morning and will not drain, suggestions?  Is it the timer and/or something else?Hi Michelle, thank you for your question. According to our research, you need to do the following things to fix your issue: check for blockages, load the dishwasher correctly, clean or change the filter, part number PS3511267, inspect the drain hose, part number PS260686, double-check the drain valve, and try vinegar and baking soda. If these cannot fix your issue then you will need to check the following parts: drain solenoid kit, part number PS1481923, and the pump and motor assembly, part number PS3486941. Please reach out to customer service if you need help placing an order. Glad to be of help!"

The spray arm seal for your dishwasher (part number: PS11745444) is in fact manufactured with the 1mm break in it that you describe. Replacing the seal may help with the issue of the spray arm not cleaning the top rack properly.

If the dishes on the upper rack are not getting clean, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the chopper assembly, the spinner kit, the spray arm seal, sump pump check valve, the spray arm seal, the impellar and seal kit, the heating element, the circulation pump and motor, the lower spray arm support/hub, the water supply manifold probe and the feed tube assembly with spinner.

I’ve just been throwing the soap pod in the water after it’s been running for 5 minutes and it’s starting to get bothersome. What part do i need?  The door shaft and black rotating arm look fine. Is it the white arm on the timer? It’s really sloppy.Hello Breck, thank you for your question.

      "Hi, my dryer is emitting a burning smell this happened one before and I replaced the belt (which fixed the problem) but now it is happening again. Should I be replacing something else or could the belt be faulty already??? ThanksHi Lorna, great question! Based on your symptoms we recommend checking the idler pulley and rollers on your dryer for tightness. If they are quite tight they should be replaced, and that should stop the burning smell. Please let us know if you have any further questions.",
      "I bought this part and I am replacing the old belt. I see a few groove options to wrap it around, one is prettttty deep and the other seems just out of reach? Which do I use?Hello Rene, great question! The belt does not usually slide in a groove, it is simply wound around the drum. When the belt is installed try turning the drum slowly to let it align properly. Best of luck with this repair!",
      "So my dryer goes hot and sometimes tumbles, but sometimes it is very slow and other times it is normal… from what I can tell. Reading around I thought to change the belt but now I dont know if that will fix it. Thoughts? Advice? Help?Hello Avery, our advice to you is to first check the rollers on your dryer to make sure they are not seizing up and sticking. This could be caused by excessive wear and visible damage. I hope this helps!",
      "The dryer will not turn unless I lighten the load inside. Anything more than a few items and it refuses to spin. Is it the belt or something else?Hello Richard,\n\nThanks for your question. Usually this is due to the belt, assuming the clothes are not over-capacity for the dryer. You may also want to check the drum glides to see if they are intact, along with the idley pulley wheels.\n\nI hope this helps.",
      "My dryer is not geting hotHi Michael,\nThank you for your inquiry.  There are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  If you have an electric dryer you will need to check the heating element, the high limit thermostat and the cycling thermostat.  If you have a gas dryer you will need to check the igniter, the radiant flame sensor, the gas control valve and the coils.  There are some other parts you will need to check as well.  They are the temperature sensor, the timer and the thermal fuse. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "My dryer was making a loud squealing sound so I took it apart as per your videos but how do I know if the belt is bad or if it is the rollers or the idler pulley? I do not know how to tell if they are good or bad.Hello Mike,\n\nThanks for your question. A bad squealing noise is typically due to bad rollers or the idler pulley. Inspect the rollers and the pulley for any signs of wear or damage visually and replace them if they are damaged.\n\nI hope this helps.",
      "My dryer won't start. If i press the knob to start it, it just makes a loud noise like it's trying to start but the drum does not move.  If i turn the drum then try pressing the knob it will start up for a minute but quits again. Then only makes the same noise if i try again.Hello Starla, Thank you for the question. The first thing to check is the belt to ensure it is not wore out and lose and able to grip and tumble the drum. In most cases with a loud noise and no tumbling or a slow tumble, the motor would be defective and needs to be replaced. Hope this helps!",
      "My dryer is gas and when i run it on empty it gets hot the steam comes out hot the drum is hot when i touch it ,but as soon as i load it with clothes and run it , it does not get very hot i have to do two 60 minutes cycles in order to dry the clothes i check the belt is fine what else do you suggest can be wrong please advise thank you very muchHi Mario, thank you for your question. When you are experiencing an issue like this there are a few parts that you will have to test to determine what is causing your issue. For all of these parts you can test them with a multi meter. First you will have to test your thermostats and thermal fuses to make sure they are all functioning correctly. After that you will want to test parts in this order, your m series coils, igniter itself, or your radiant flame sensor. You may also want to check your regulator just to make sure that part is functioning properly as well.  Something else you should also check would be your filter and ducts. Make sure there is absolutely no blockage that would restrict air flow in your appliance. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Just replaced belt and it still squeaks,any help?Hello Gary,\n\nThank you for your question. \nIf you have just replaced the belt and it still squeaks, there could be a couple of causes. It could be that the belt was installed with the grooves facing out which is allowing it to slide on the drum. However, the most likely cause would be a lack of tension on the belt. I would recommend double checking the belt path and that the idler is installed correctly and providing tension on the belt. \n\nI hope this helps!",
      "Dryer ignites 5 seconds then shuts off and continues same processHello Steve, Thank you for your inquiry. We would recommend checking the following parts to fix your issue:  high limit thermostat, cycling thermostat, \"M\" series new style coil kit, radiant flame sensor, thermostat boosting heater, and the door switch kit. You can test the parts with a multimeter. Hope this helps!"

      "The right track on the upper basket broke. Do you have a video on how to remove the basket from the track and also how to replace the track to see if i can do the repairs myself or not?Hello Doug and thanks for writing.\nWe do not have a video but here are step by step instructions.\nUse a 1/4\" nut driver to remove the bottom front (kick) plate from the appliance. There are two screws, one at each end. There should also be two screws fastening the dishwasher to the countertop. You'll need to open the dishwasher door to see these and remove them. At the bottom of the dishwasher again, you might need to screw the front (2) leveling feet in to lower the dishwasher and provide clearance. Once done, just (gently, slowly) pull the appliance out of the cabinet. Check to make sure your power wiring, drain hose, and water supply hose are all long enough to do this. If necessary, disconnect any of these that are too short. if your power wiring is short, as mine was, you'll need to disconnect the circuit breaker, then remove the junction box at the lower front right side of the dishwasher, then disconnect the power and ground wires.\nOnce out of the cabinet, use a 5/16\" nut driver to remove the four screws holding each rack slide in place and remove the track. The rubber mounts will come out with the track (new tracks include new rubber mounts). Clean any residue from the track mounting area inside the tub before installing the new track. This whole replacement process should take a total of 3-4 minutes per side.\nTo finish up, just reverse the process. When sliding the dishwasher back into place, make sure the fiberglass insulation stays in place completely around the outside of the tub. We hope this helps. Please contact us anytime.",

      "Can you detail what does this part do exactly ?? PS12070543.  ThanksHello JP, thank you for your question. The turbidity sensor measures the amount of transmitted light to determine the turbidity of the wash water. These turbidity measurements are supplied to the dishwasher controller, which makes decisions on how long to wash in all the cycles. Thank you and have a great day.",
      "My dishwasher is only 2 years old.  After i cleaned the filters and the spray arms the problem started.  The machine would fill and drain, but would not wash, most of the time.  I did get it to wash a couple of times while trying different cycles, removing and replacing the filters, and running the diagnostic cycle, though i can't say there was any clear cause and effect between what i did and it suddenly working briefly.  Now it won't wash at all.  Could this be the sensor?  Or more likely the motor?Hello Lee, Thank you for your inquiry. It sounds more like the pump and motor assembly part# W11032770. You can test it with a multimeter to see if it functioning properly. Hope this helps!",
      "My kitchen aid dishwasher will sometimes not finish draining at the end of the drying cycle... have checked to make sure that there is no obstructions in the hose and garbage disposal (took drain hose off totally)… when hose was disconnected i poured a glass of water in the bottom and it ran right out thru the bottom of the machine... tried resetting the system using 3 buttons in sequence 3x then the cancel button and also cut power to it.... after sitting for a couple of hours i can press the cancel button and it will drain.... could it be this sensor part or maybe a bad pump??Hello Bryan and thank you for writing.\nIt certainly sounds like a faulty drain pump PS11738151 you should check for signs of damage, and replace it if needed.   We hope this helps. Please contact us anytime.",

Check the wash arm impeller inside the pump and motor, also consider the idea that the pump and motor assembly, part number PS11770231, may be bad. Examine the spray arms to see if any of them are clogged, and clean them if needed. Test the float switch, part number PS11750031, with a multimeter for continuity and replace it if it does not show continuity. We hope this solves your problem!",
      "What are the ohms supposed to be on the drain pump, and do I need to buy the sensor along with the pump?Hi Thor, Thank you for the question. The pump shoudl be around 37 ohms.  Replacing the sensor would depend on the issue you are having. Hope this helps!",
      "will the turbidity senson cause the heating element to not functionHello Steve, thank you for the question. The turbidity sensor measures the amount of transmitted light to determine the turbidity of the wash water. The turbidity sensor measurements make decisions on how long to wash in all the cycles. If your dishwasher is stuck in the wash cycle, even though the dishes are clean, and does not go in the heating cycle it means you have a faulty turbidity sensor, part number PS12070543. If your dishwasher goes into the heating cycle and does not dry dishes, it means the turbidity sensor is okay and the issue is most probably with the heating element part number PS8260087.

A faulty high-limit thermostat can cause the heating element to not turn on.  Use a multimeter to test the high-limit thermostat for continuity. If the high-limit thermostat, part number PS11743423, does not have continuity you may need to replace it. There is a turbidity sensor in the dishwasher sump which detects the soil level in the water to detect the cleanliness of dishes. We hope this helps.",

Based on our understanding, the issue is most probably with the control board, part number PS12745387. It manages the functions of the dishwasher, such as washing, draining and drying. You may need to replace it to fix the issue. We hope this solves your problem!"

      "My dishwasher just beeps continuously when it is closed and it does not respond to button presses. I have tried cycling the power and cutting it off at the breaker. Should I replace the control board?Hi Chris,\nThank you for your question.  If the dishwasher is beeping continuously, it may have had a recent power surge and it may need to be reset.  Try unplugging the dishwasher for 5 minutes to allow it to reset, if you turn it back on there is likely an issue with either the membrane or the electronic control board.  You will need to test the parts with a multimeter.  Here is a link to one of our videos on YouTube that you may reference on how to use one, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWC44fHn0As.

      "Does the Float lever (V V 10195037)  keep the unit from starting. Originally when I shut the door and try to select wash cycle, usually 1hour wash, switch does not light up and nothing starts Cannot get any of those lights to light up when pressed. I then tried to reset the unit. I had no luck. please advise thank you.Hi Warren, thank you for the question. Based on our research, the float lever only activates the float switch to shut off the water supply if the water level rises too high, it does not prevent the unit from starting at all. The most probable cause of this issue is a faulty door latch, part number PS8770043, which may be preventing the dishwasher from starting and may need to be replaced. We hope this information is useful!"

      "How can you tell when you need to replace wash arm bearing ring (part #: Ps11747064), and/or wash arm bearing nut (part #: Ps11747063)?  Can you look at the original and see wear?  Can you tell by spinning the wash arm?  It spins freely but wobbles...is this normal?   my dishwasher is leaking from under the front door.  it doesn't seem to be the door seal gasket.\n thanksHello Jill, thank you for your question. The bearing nut and wash arm bearing might shows signs of wear; scuffs, cracks, chips, ect. They might be slightly uneven, or warped. The spray arm should not wobble, it should spin evenly when pushed with your finger. I would suggest replacing the bearing ring as well as the nut. Check the spray arm as well to be sure its not warped and needs to be replaced as well. I hope this helps!",
      "What makes lower spray arm be wobbly?Hello Lela, thank you for your question. Usually the lower spray arm gets wobbly because of any of these three parts. Part Number: PS11745480, Part Number: PS11741334, Part Number: PS11747064. The most common issue is a broken or cracked bearing ring. Over time the wear on these parts can cause the spray arm to become unsteady. I hope this helps!",
      "Need to order part hat holds spray arm in placeHi Linda, I think we can help you out. There are two parts that hold your lower spray arm in place. One is the wash arm bearing ring (part #: PS11747064), and the other is the wash arm bearing nut (part #: PS11747063). The bearing nut screws into the bearing ring, and keeps the spray arm in place. You can order either one, depending on which piece needs replacing. Hopefully this helps you with the repair.",
      "Portable dishwasher leaks from bottom after cycle is completed and unit has been moved away from sink. Where would you suggest I start looking for leak?Hi Carol,\n\nThank you for the question. One of the more common problems when leaking is the Drain and Wash Impeller Kit, I suggest starting here to make sure the seal and parts are all intact. While looking at the impeller kit it will be a good idea to also check the seals around the pump. \n\n\nHope this helps!",
      "The washer won't start the wash, rinse or drain cycles (pump won't start). The washer fills. The control board lights up and the buttons seem to be functioning correctly. Water drains out when the drain hose is removed from the drain valve located on the bottom portion of the  motor. Before replacing the motor could there be a relay,switch or fuse that would not start the motor?Hello Jesse, thank you for your question. We would recommend testing these two parts before replacing anything. High Limit Thermostat Part Number: WP661566 and Fuse Assembly Part Number: 675796. Usually if the dishwasher won't start, there is an issue with a fuse, or thermostat in the unit. I hope this helps!",
      "You guys show a ring that fits below the nut on the bottom impeller this machine does not have this what it does have is a metal ring that is attached to the metal impeller which is comeing loss allowing the impeller to get wedged under this stopping the action will this plastic ring i have ordered solve this???? please replyHi Carrol,\nThank you for your question.  I believe the part you are looking for is in the impeller kit, part number PS382822. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

      "Does the lower door seal ( gray plastic piece) cause water leak under the machine ?Hi Ammar, it is definitely possible if this piece is faulty.  Thank you for your question and good luck with your repair!",
      "IS THERE ANY INSTRUCTION VIDEO ON HOW TO REPLACE THIS DISHWASHER SEAL?Hi Joseph,\nThank you for your question.  We do not have a video for this part, but here is some information that a customer posted that may help you with your repair, \"Turn off the power to the unit at your breaker panel.  The air inlet strip is fastened to the backside of the inner stainless steel door panel.  To access the screws, the outer door panel must be removed.  Open the door and remove the six torx head screws that fasten the outer door panel to the stainless steel inner door.  Do not remove the two top center torx screws as they hold the door latch in place.   After removing the screws, raise the door up to the nearly closed position.  Lift up the outer door panel handle and door bottom to disengage the outer panel from the inner stainless door.  The next part is a little tricky since the vent strip hex head screws are at he bottom of the stainless door panel, facing out with the door closed.  The lip of the bottom stainless pan is high enough to make it a tight fit to access the screws.  There is also a steel bracket that is a door stiffener and it holds the electrical wiring.  I found removing the bracket held by a 1/4 inch hex head screw on each side made access to the vent strip screws easier.  Lay it flat on the floor.  With a 3/16 inch nut driver or socket wrench remove each of the five vent strip screws.  It is a tight fit between the bottom lip and door bottom, but it can be done.  Remove the old vent strip and attach the new one.  Make sure it fits snugly into the slot. Best to have an extra pair of hands at this point to hold the strip securely in place while the screws are reinserted from the opposite side.  Reassemble everything in reverse order.\"   We hope this helps!  If you have any questions, please let us know."

      "On the pump diagram part # 410 is called a sensor. Is this the sensor that determines how much water to let in. My unit is overfilling with a e 17 error code. According to Bosch codes that means water flow sensor fault overfilling problem. In my sump next to the filter are 2 sensors, one above the other. One i think is to determine the soil level on the auto cycle. Is the other one the water level sensor?Hello Jim, thank you for your question. The turbidity sensor measures the soil level in the water that is going through the pump and sump. As the soil level increases, the amount of transmitted light decreases. The turbidity sensor measures the amount of transmitted light to determine the turbidity of the wash water. These turbidity measurements are supplied to the dishwasher controller, which makes decisions on how long to wash in all the cycles.The E17 code is indicating the unit is getting too much water into the tub. We would recommend testing or replacing the float switch and water valve first. I hope this helps!",

If I leave a bit water in the machine it will not start.Hi Matt,\nThank you for your question.  If your dishwasher will not start, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the door lock, the electronic control board, the control panel, the heat pump and the drain pump.  We have included a link that you may reference on how to check some of these parts.  Once you have determined the part you need, please feel free to call customer service.

      "I’m a bit stumped and would appreciate guidance. The dishwasher displays water tap while running, followed by water leaking to the float and an E15 error.\n\nI checked everything and the drain line is completely clear, and it drains fine when you reset it. I bought new tub seal and door seals from you and installed them. For some reason the tub is still overfilling and then overflowing while running.\n\nIs this a fill level sensor or some other way to control the fill?Hello Harry, thank you for your inquiry. An E15 error code indicates that the safety switch has detected water in the base of the dishwasher. Your leakage protection system has activated. Check to make sure the water inlet hose and sump seal are not damaged or worn-out and are leading to water leakage. If this does not solve the issue, we would recommend checking the float switch assembly, part number PS8737139. Float switch assembly shuts the water fill valve off if the water level gets too high before the timed fill cycle ends. Good luck with the repair!"

It is likely that there is a problem with your interlock spring switch, or that the drum belt has become loose. The motor will not remain running when the start button is released if there are loose wires with the interlock switch. You can also test the switch for continuity if you have a multi-meter, and we would advise to replace it if it is not showing continuity.\n\nI hope this helps.",

You should have at least two of each on your appliance from what I am seeing. two on the blower housing and then two on the heating element.

There are a few different parts you will want to test with a multimeter to see if they have continuity. Replace them if they show no continuity. Test the interlock switch and the door latch. You may then want to test the motor and pump out to see if they are working properly.\n\nI hope this helps."

      "Just bought the pump.  Pulled out the old pump.  Inside the sump where the implore on the pump connects to the sump is a plastic gear.  That gear is loose, i could pull it out.  Appears to be broken - but not sure. If it's broken - does a new sump come with all the parts? Or do i need to salvage parts from my existing sump to put into the new sump.  The pictures of the sump do not clearly indicate if the internal parts are already there.Hi Randy,\n\nThank you for your question. If you take a look at your diagram there this is part number 4. Your diagram actually shows the parts that will come separately from your sump. This part is just your sump housing, it looks like any internal parts would not come with it. You do have assemblies that you can choose from underneath your model depending on what you need to come inside of your sump. Good luck with your repair.",
      "The dishwasher seems to have good pressure and water flow to lower wash arm but there isn't any water going up the tube to middle wash arm nor the upper wash arm. The dishwasher sounds normal when running. I did clean the sump and check for clogged water ways, all good. Do you have any idea where to check next?Hello David, Thank you for the question. You may have a defective Circulation Pump and Motor, PartSelect #: PS11757388. The part functions by spinning the impeller of the circulation pump, which is used to move the water through the spray arms during the wash cycle. If it is defective, water may not reach the middle and top spray arms. Hope this helps!",

Yes, you can test both of those parts with a multi meter to determine whether or not they are broken. There are two micro switches on your door latch that you will test, and then just your timer.

I even moved the hook-latch (ps2098991) back so the door would close more, but now it's really hard to close the door. Even so, it will start if i continue to push and hold the door, but it stops when i let go. Is there some lower door adjustment? From the side it looks like the bottom of the door is much closer to the frame(?) than the top of the door is. I think if the bottom can be move out a bit, it would work. Please advise.

It works with the heating element to seal the receptacle opening where the heating element is attached. The rubber washer is used to prevent water leaking from your dishwasher during its cycle. Before making any repairs to your dishwasher make sure that you disconnect the power by finding the breaker for the dishwasher, and turning it off. The tools you will need to complete this repair include an adjustable wrench, and a 1/4 inch nut driver. This specific rubber washer is sold individually.\n",

      "Whole board does not light up or workHello Dave,  Thank you for contacting us. I have researched the model you have provided and have found the part you’re looking for is Part Number: PS8260219. Good luck with the repair!",
      "The rinse aid appears to be draining quicker than normal and a film is forming below the rinse aid component on the door.  Is there a way to fix this?  I've checked the seal on the fill cap and i've also adjusted the inside control lever.  Neither seem to help.  The detergent side of the component works fine.  Dishes are clean and don't appear to have any more spots than normal.Hello Will, thank you for your question. There is probably a small leak in the rinse aid compartment. I would recommend replacing the whole dispenser for your appliance (which is the only way to fix any issue with the dispenser as it is sold as an assembly). Per your model number WDT910SAYE0 the dispenser is part number PS11752440. I hope this helps!",
      "I have a kitchen aid kuds40fvwh2. My problem is there is water in the bottom of the dishwasher when the cylcle is finished. But when you push cancel the water will drain. Check valve is intact drain hose is clear and not kinked.Hello John, thank you for your question. If the water will drain when cancel is pushed, the drain pump is functioning. If you've checked the check valve and it is in good condition the water is not coming back into the unit. It sounds like the issue is the electronic control board that is not functioning. The board is like a \"timer\". It runs the cycles, fill, wash, rinse, drain, ect. If the board is going bad the unit isn't getting the signal to drain at the end of the cycle. I would recommend replacing the board, part number WPW10285179. I hope this helps!",
      "How difficult is it to replace water pump?Hi Don, thank you for your question. Unfortunately we do not have instructions for your model specifically. However we actually do have multiple installation videos on our YouTube channel that will show you how this installation is usually done: https://www.youtube.com/user/partselect/search?query=dishwasher+pump. Good luck with your repair.",
      "No water sprays out during wash the cycle. Just had a new board put in.Hi Don,\nThank you for your question.  If the dishwasher is not spraying water during its cycle, this may be a result of the following:\n\n1. Spray arm is clogged.\n2. Dishwasher is overloaded.\n3. Blocked Dishwasher pump.\n4. Overfill float switch malfunction.\n5. Water supply issue.\n6. Water pressure problem.\n\nYou will need to check these issues and verify which one is causing the issue and fix it.\n \nI hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "Not cleaning, water not hot. Put in new thermostat and heat element and cleaned top filter. All done but still not hit water or clean. What next??Hello Joanne, thank you for your question. If the element and thermostat were replaced and you're still having the same issue, the main control board is the most likely issue. I hope this helps.",
      "When ordering the rubber washer do they come 2 in a pack or do I need to order 2?Hello William, Thank you for the question. The Rubber Washer is sold individually and one is required for the Element. We hope this helps!",
      "Can I purchase part # WPW10455268 seal only ?Hello Bruce, thank you for reaching out. The seal is only sold as part of the sump. In order to replace the seal, the sump will need to be replaced. We hope this information helps!",
      "Rubber seals gone in Kenmore dish washer, will that not get thing cleaning, where can you get themHello Russell, thank you for contacting us, In order for us to locate the correct parts and repair information we will require the model number of the unit.

It appears that your washer may have a damaged timer control, part number PS6011664, and it needs to be replaced. The orange floating ball that you mentioned goes into the inlet sump.

      "Is this water inlet valve compatible or will it work with my GE dishwasher. Dishwasher will not fill with water. I poured a couple of pitchers of hot water up to the heater element to simulate the dishwasher was filled with water. I could hear it washing and it did drain, but dishwasher will not fill with water on its own.Hi Charles, Thank you for the question. Yes, this Valve is the correct valve for the model number provided. Good luck with the repair!",
      "Considering buying new water inlet valve?  The water would not stop running into dishwasher (even with door open) and even when power turned off.  I shut off water and waited.  After 10 minutes i turned water back on and it had stopped.  I don't know what else it could be.  I think if it were the float, the water would have stopped running when i opened the door (and when the power was turned off).  Thoughts?Hello Daniel, thank you for your question. Yes, if the water continued to run into the unit even after the door was opened and power was off, the water valve is stuck in an open position. I would recommend replacing the water valve to fix this problem! Good luck with your repair!",
      "When the dishwasher fills up with water it does not stop water poured out on the floor. When I turned off the washer opened the door the water was still running in filling it up, I had to turn the water off to get it to stop. I replaced the float switch it did not help. What does the inlet valve do and could that be bad.Hi John, Thank you for the question. The valve releases water into the tub. If the float did not fix the issue the next part to replace would be the water inlet valve. Hope this helps!",
      "On my dishwasher when the wash cycle is complete and the dishes are clean and the clean indicator light is on, there is a humming noise coming from inside the dishwasher when the door is closed, like something is still running. When the door is open, the noise stops. When the door is closed again the humming noise comes back. Can you help me?Hi Thomas,\n\nThank you for your question. It sounds like you may want to physically check your drain area. Something may be jammed, like the chopper assembly, your pump and motor mechanism, or your drain pump. You would have to pull out your dishwasher for this and take it apart a bit. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",

      "I could visually see a leak coming from my old inlet valve (once i knew i had a leak!) so i ordered this replacement, which reconnected in just fine - except for the two screws to hold the bracket to the frame of the dishwasher.  As mentioned in the video, the original screws are 5/16, but they won't screw into the new bracket (whether trying to attach it to the dishwasher or just trying screw right to bracket as a test).  Did the threading on these change at some point so my original screws won't fit this new replacement part? (it didn't come with screws).  Thanks.Hi Ed, I know this part does not come with screws. It is a replacement for an older part.  The specs for the screws seem to be 10 - 32 t hex 7/16 s. Thank you for your question and good luck with your repair!",
      "My dishwasher runs and drains ok, but over a few hours there is an accumulation of clean water in the bottom. Sometimes it as much as an inch. Does this suggest that the intake valve is not functioning correctly?Hi Lewis, thank you for your question. It is normal for some water to be present in the bottom of the dishwasher. But, if the water is present in large quantity may be the water inlet valve, part number PS3654179, is malfunctioning. Before replacing it check the drainage system is not clogged, which can restrict the water flow. We hope this sorts out your problem!",

Sometimes this will fix the problem for a time or two but then the problem returns. Any ideas? Thanks.Hello Louis, thank you for inquiring.

I have researched the model you have provided and have found the part you are looking for is PartSelect Number PS972325 for the Door Balance Link Kit. This part is a door balance link kit, also sometimes known as door cable or door spring cable kit, that helps support the door as it opens and closes by connecting to the dishwasher door hinges. The kit includes two door balance links and two door balance mounts with wheels, which will replace both the left and right sides. The only tool needed is a 5/16 nut driver. Before removing the existing kit, take note of how the door balance link kit is assembled for a smooth replacement process. It is recommended to check the door springs in case they need to be replaced as well. Hope this helps!",

If the cap has melted or it is not sealing the dispenser properly, the part should be replaced right away.

      "Hi, my dishwasher has every once in a while after a cycle is over will just flash clean with the Green light and am unable to clear it. I recently found online a way to re set which is heated dry and normal 2x but i am wondering if there is more wrong that i should worry about. I recently ordered the cap for the dispense to maybe that will help. It seems my dishes are not getting as clean as they should and the soap not all the way breaking down. Do you think ordering the new cap will solve that issue? I have gone without one for month and just started recently having this problem more often.Hi Marissa,\nThank you for your question.  The lights will blink on your dishwasher if your dishwasher detects an error.  In this case there is a cleaning error.  If the dishwasher is not cleaning the dishes correctly, you will need to check the chopper assembly, the spinner kit, the spray arm seal, the sump pump check valve, the spray arm seal, the impeller and seal kit, the heating element, the water inlet valve and the circulation pump.  Also, the water may not be hot enough to dissolve the soap.  Before running a cycle, turn the hot water on and let it run for a few minutes and then run a cycle and make sure there is good water pressure.  If the dishes are not getting clean, the dishes may be loaded in a way that prevents all of the dishes from being cleaned.  Try arranging them so that the water can reach all of them.  Try varying the amount of soap used as well to see if that helps.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",

      "Having trouble with touch pad on top of door.  Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't.  What do you think needs replaced.Hello Rick, Thank you for your inquiry. You can test the connector of the display assembly with a multimeter to see if it is working. If that tests good for continuity, then you can test if it is the console or the control panel, by shutting off the power, disconnect the console from the main control board, then put the door back together. Leaving the door open, reconnect the power and then after 10 minutes, shut the dishwasher door. If the control board is working properly, it will turn the drain pump on and the issue is with the touchpad console. If not, then the issue is with the main control board. We hope this helps and if you need help placing an order, customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you!"

      "Why won't my cycles change dial does not moveHi Audrey,\nThank you for your question.  If the dial is not moving and the cycles are not changing, the issue could be with the timer, the door latch, interlck switch or the dial.  Check the parts to see if they are positioned and working correctly.  You can check the electronic parts with a multimeter to see if they have continuity.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

This sounds like an issue with the Electronic control board, Part #: PS8260218. Thank you for your inquiry, good luck with this repair!",
      "I have a Maytag dishwasher that when I select the normal cycle (or any other cycle), several other settings become selected and I cannot unselect them. The start button will not light. Sometimes the machine will start washing, but mostly does not. Is this a control panel issue or a control module issue?Hello Doug, Thank you for the question. Normally this is an indication the Dishwasher Electronic Control is defective and will need to be replaced. We hope this helps!",

Just stays lit up with the settings it seems to be stuck with. Is this a control panel issue or touch pad issue?Hello Carmen, thank you for your question. It is most likely a control panel issue. The buttons are probably stuck. We would recommend replacing the control panel first. If that doesn't fix the issue the board would have to be replaced. I hope this helps!",
      "Our dishwasher is not heating/drying.  The heating element has continuity and the i replaced the thermostat so i think it's the control board.How can i test the our control board and is this the correct replacement board?Hi  Matthew, thank you for your question. You could take a look at the wiring at the element and into your appliance for any damages. However if your wiring is fine then it is likely your board that is the issue. Unfortunately only a technician would be able to test an electronic control board. There are too many components on the piece so you have to know what you are doing to be able to do it correctly. Good luck with your repair.",

I do not think I need the outside control panel, right?Hello Laura, Thank you for the Question. If it is just the Start Button that is not working, the Front Control Panel with Touch Pad will need to be replaced. It is the most used and can wear out. If you need help placing an order, customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you!",

If you have checked these parts and they are fine, there are some other parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the overfill control switch, the circulation pump and the electronic control board.  Once you have determined the part you need, please feel free to call customer service.

If your dishwasher does not turn on, you will need to check the electronic control board, the door latch and the circulation and drain pump motors.  We have included a link from our website that you may reference on how to check these parts.  Once you have determined the part you need, please call customer service.  We look forward to hearing from you!",
      "Initially when the door was open, a few led button started  to beep; i pushed \"cancel\" but after a few minutes started to beep again. Very annoying. I turned off and on the electricity \n But did not fix the issue. I reset the dishwasher (pushed rinse 5 times, then drain 2 times,) did not fix the issue.  Meanhwile the dishwasher works and clean just fine. Now the led button do not beep or led turn on when selected, yet the dishwasher still works and clean ok. I believe it is either the control panel part # ps11755340 or the central electric part# ps8260218. Is there anyone that can help me to sort this out so i can oredr the right part? ThanksHello Paolo, thank you for your question. From the description you have provided it sounds like the issue is with the control panel itself. I hope this helps!"

      "My dishwasher fills up with water and sounds like it is working for a few minutes, but then stops making noise until it drains. The water is hot, the soap dispenses, but just sits on the bottom of the tub. The dishes are not clean at the end, but they are wet. Would this be the correct part to replace?Hello Jonathan, thank you for your question. Yes, it sounds like water is not being circulated through the unit to turn the spray arms and wash the dishes. We would recommend replacing the circulation pump/motor PartSelect Number PS11773089. Good luck with your repair!",
      "Will fill with water but will not go through spray arms drains fine  is it the motor/pumpHi Galen,\nThank you for your question.  If the water is not going through the spray arms, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the filter, the turbidity sensor, the heating element, the push-in retainer clip, the water inlet valve, the motor pump, the pump, the spray arms and the drain hose.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "Is there a video on changing the motor pumpHi Barb,\nThank you for your question.  There is a video on our website that you can reference on how to install the pump.  The dishwasher in the video may not show exactly like the one you have, but it will give you a general idea on how to install the part.  You will find the video under part number PS11753379.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "I have water entering the dishwasher but it does not seem to be making pressure. I do not hear water going through the spray bars. It drains fine. Could this be the motor/pump or the motor?Hello Chad,\n\nThanks for your question. The motor and pump assembly is the more likely cause for your issue. It can also be a good idea to examine the water inlet valve, part number PS11752927, to check if that is intact.\n\nI hope this helps.",
      "Dishwasher wont drainHi Luwan, Thank you for the question. The most common part replaced if it is not draining would be the drain pump, PartSelect Number PS11753379.Here is a link to the video on how to do the repair. Hope this helps!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRTH3Wq_Apw",

Is it the diverted motor, or motor and pump? Unit is 4 years old.Hello Domenic, thank you for your question. If the unit is not pumping water through the unit, but is filling and draining you should replace the MOTOR-PUMP W11032770.

      "Im not exactly sure what's happening with my dishwasher. The inside of the tub is always dirty and my kids always say that the cups smell like throw up. Nothing seems to be getting clean. Ive had to manually clean out the dishwasher from black sludge. Its pretty nasty. I paid 700 for this machine and its been nothing but a pain. Ive had 3 repair s for it and and never had it actually working properly. Please help me!Hello Julie, thank you for your question. We would recommend removing the filter PartSelect Number: PS11759673 and screen PartSelect Number: PS11755148 and cleaning them well. You may also want to remove the spray arms and clean them well. Reassemble the unit and run a cycle with vinegar and water. If that doesn't clean the smell, you may want to replace the circulation pump, sump and the hoses. I hope this helps!",
      "The machine drains. But it does not wash.  Which pump would it be ?Hi Allen, If your washer fills with water but doesn't agitate, the problem is likely to be a faulty lid switch, a broken belt, or a problem with the motor. If it is a motor it likely would be the pump motor. Thank you for your question and good luck with your repair!",

      "Does this pump heat the water as it circulates it?Hello Stephen, Thank you for contacting us. The circulation pump only circulates the water to the spray arms. For the model number that you have provided, the heating element would actually help to heat the water, but you should still make sure there is hot water flowing into the dishwasher from the fill hoses. We hope this helps and if you need help placing an order, customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you!"

If there is a build up of detergent in the dishwasher this can prevent the detergent from leaving the dispenser.  You will need to clean the dispenser with warm soapy water.  Also, make sure the that the water entering the dishwasher is hot enough to dissolve the soap.  You may have to run the hot water for a few minutes in the kitchen sink before using the dishwasher. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

      "During normal cycle a lot of water is coming out the bottom of the door.  This doesn't seem to happen on 1 hour cycle.  Would this be a problem with the overflow control switch or another part?  Thanks!Hello Jennifer, thank you for your question. Yes, the float switch (also known as the overfill control switch) helps control the water level. If it goes bad, it is possible that the dishwasher may flood or leak. You may want to test it with a multi-meter to see if it has continuity and replace it if it does not show continuity. I hope this helps!",
      "What does the overfill controll switch doHi Andrew,\n\nThank you for your question. The overfill switch, or float switch as it is sometimes called, makes sure that your appliance does not over fill with water. It also helps the drain pump know when the water has been all drained out of the machine. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "My Whirlpool gold series dishwasher keeps on filling and draining it will not go to wash cycle. What do you think the problem is?Hello Mario,\n\nThanks for your question. This will vary from model to model for the exact parts, but you will want to check the water inlet valve with a multi-meter for continuity, replacing it if it shows no continuity. Check the wash arm impeller inside the pump and motor, as well as considering the idea that the pump may be bad. Examine the spray arms to see if any of them are clogged and clean them if needed. Test the float switch as well with a multi-meter for continuity and replace it if it does not show continuity.\n\nI hope this helps.",
      "The dishwasher will not fill. Can you help?Hello Nicole,\n\nThanks for your question. Your water inlet valve may be clogged or defective. It could be worth considering replacing it. Your problem may also be the float switch, so replace that if the inlet valve is fine.\n\nI hope this helps.",
      "Machine overfills and leaks at front of door. Float switch tests good. Fill valve tested good but replaced because of some rust stains on screen. Float moves freely.

      "DISHWASHER - MAYTAG MODEL MDBH979SAM0\nType 577-1\nHi - we had water leaking, and at first it seemed to be the water inlet valve, and we replaced that. New part seems good, no more leaks detected there. Then I noticed a drip from the water inlet hose, and replaced that. No more leaks there. However, water was still (or now) pouring through the bottom of the front door (machine was out from its usual place under cabinet, on tile floor), and at that point I suspected the door gasket, and replaced that. However, issue was not fixed, so we then replaced the front door lower seal as the old one had some hard water build up I couldn't remove (PS11755651), and we also took out the lower (and upper) wash arm parts, cleaned those, and cleaned the upper portion of the sump pump (accumulator and filter, and top of sump pump) of gudge. And, then did our best to LEVEL the machine, which stopped the gush of water, but there is still water filling up in and then draining out of the metal tray at the bottom of the door, (above the white padded material) and coming past the door's lower seal.Hello Heather, thank you for the question. Since you have replaced and cleaned the most common parts that can cause leaking, we would recommend checking the float switch, part number PS11750031. It shuts the water fill valve off if the water level gets too high before the timed fill cycle ends. We hope this helps!",
      "You suggested that I replace the overfill switch. I stated in my previous question that the float/overfill switch tested good. I checked it with a continuity tester and also operated it manually in the machine.   What else in the system will cause this problem? Thank you for any suggestions you may have.Hello Wayne,\n\nThanks for your question. You may wish to check the circulation pump and motor. It is rare for this part to be causing such leaking, but you have found that most of the other parts test well, so it may be worth examining the pump and motor as well.\n\nI hope this helps.",
      "If the overfill control switch is bad, will it cause the washer to overfill at times, and cause water to gush out the bottom of the door?Hello Dennis,\n\nThanks for your question. Yes, the float switch (also known as the overfill control switch) helps control the water level. If it goes bad, it is possible that the dishwasher may flood or leak. You may want to test it with a multi-meter to see if it has continuity and replace it if it does not show continuity.\n\nI hope this helps.",
      "Unit does not wash at all. I start it, let it run for 10 minutes, open it, and all the dishes are still dry.  I hear a humming sound lasting about 30 seconds, it stops for a few seconds and resumes, repeating, but apparently no water goes through.  I let it run a complete washing cycle, and after it is finished, soap had been dropped intact over the dishes, but was intact, not even wet, reusable.\npossible causes? Thank you in advance for your help.Hi Gustavo,\nThank you for your question.  If the dishes are not getting cleaned because there is no water entering the dishwasher and you are hearing a humming sound, it sounds like the issue is with the water inlet valve.  A component in the water inlet valve may have failed and it will need to be replaced.  The water inlet valve is usually located behind the lower access panel. Remove the lower access panel in order to locate the inlet valve.  Once you have located it, visually inspect the water inlet valve for any signs of cracking, wear, or other damage.  If any issues are found during your inspection, you will need a replacement water inlet valve.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "My dishwasher is leaking during wash cycle, and the water is leaking out at the overfill control switch. I was going to replace the switch, but is this a different problem with a seal/gasket inside instead? Thanks for your time!Hi Sean, both the switch and gasket could the problem, I would inspect the seal for damage and go from there. Thank you for your question and good luck with your repair!"

      "Is the sump #505 easy to replace?  #wd18x10026Hello Glen, the sump is a very easy repair. To do this you would unplug the unit and turn off water supply then uninstall the dishwasher from its position, pull it out completely and put on its side. Remove the top sump clamp, and remove the three other clamps. Pull out the sensor, then remove the sump. You will reuse the clamps from the old sump. Remove the sump plate as well, to be reused. You would reinstall the plate into the new sump, then slide the clamps onto the \nsump sleeves. Install the new sump. Slide in the check valve first, Push the sump on the top lip\nand then slide the drain pump into the sump. Tighten the clamps, tile the appliance back upright \nthen reinstall the dishwasher into the opening and reattach the water supply and connect power. I hope this helps!",

      "Does the tub gasket cover the whole way around the door? Including the bottom?Hi Nancy,\nThank you for your question.  This gasket will go along the top and the sides of the dishwasher.  The part number listed under your model number for the tub gasket is WD08X23477.  The bottom gasket for the door, would be part of the inner lining of the door, part number WD31X22821. If you need the lining, it has been discontinued by GE and you will need to contact them for information on a replacement part.  Their telephone number is 1-800-626-2005.  If they provide you with a part number for the replacement part, you may call us back with it and we can verify if we have it available for you.  You may also be able to locate the part you need by trying the following:\n\nUsing a search engine to type your part number and see if other retailers still have this part in stock.\nVisiting online stores such as eBay and finding sellers that have this part.\nTrying retailers and repair stores in your local area to see if they have the part in their inventory.\nTalking to a local repair technician, who may have the part you need, or may be able to repair your existing part.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",

      "My dishwasher is leaking water in the front at the bottom of the door when it is filling with water.   When i feel behind the bottom of the door there is a cable there and  i can feel the water running out at that location.  Any idea what could be causing that and what part might need to be replaced?  It just started doing it.Hi Nick,\n\nThank you for your question. I would say first check to make sure your appliance is all level and correctly attached to your cabinet walls. Sometimes when the appliance is out of level the spray arms will spray water against a part of the door where they are not supposed to and that will make it leak. You may want to take a look and test your float switch. Make sure it is not letting too much water fill your tub as well. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",

      "In my Maytag dishwasher (above model number) the black coloured plastic latch (or handle) that I used to grab to open the door of the dishwasher has broken off. I can still open the door by inserting my hand into the front cavity. I am confused from looking at the diagram in the PartSelect website whether to order a handle or door latch?  Also do I need a connector.  Thank you!Hi Kersi,\nThank you for your question. The handle for your dishwasher can be purchased separately.  The part number listed under your model number for the handle is PS11752989. You should not need a connector.  To install the part, first make sure that the dishwasher has been either unplugged from the electrical outlet or that the circuit breaker has been turned off.  Unscrew the inside door panel using a star screw driver. Unscrew the broken plastic handle and replace it with the new handle. Once the door has been put back together, restore the power to the dishwasher. Everything should now work for you. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "I'm not sure which part to order.  When you open the dishwasher, the entire plastic top panel lifts out of place.  Is this called the \"handle\"?Hi Diann,\nThank you for your question.  If the panel you are referring to is the control panel then you will either need to refasten it to the door or order a new one if it is damaged.  There are 3 control panels listed under your model number.  The part number listed under your model number for the black control panel is PS11723016.  The part number listed for the white control panel is PS11723017.  The part number listed for the stainless steel control panel is PS11723019. If it is the handle itself that is coming apart from the door, then you will need to refasten it to the door or replace it if it is damaged. \nIf you need to place an order for one of these parts, you may order it either online or by calling our customer service line and anyone will be happy to assist you.  We hope this helps!  If you have any questions, please let us know."

The screws are around the inner edge of the inner door panel and once that is removed the vent can be accessed. The deflector is held into place by clips which can be depressed and the deflector pushed out of the inner panel. I hope this helps!"

I’ve checked the filter and drain hose numerous times and both appear clean and clear.Hi Peter, thank you for getting in touch. Based on our research, the most likely cause of this issue is a faulty drain pump, part number PS11738151, which may need to be replaced. We hope this sorts out your problem!",
      "Dishwasher runs through cycle but water remains when finished. Hose and air gap clear. Drain pump impeller appears ok and pump tests normally for continuity, but does “click” when activated. Does this sound like a pump issue or a control board problem?Hi Michael, thank you for contacting us. A little water left over after a cycle is normal. It keeps the seals from drying up and your dishwasher will pump it out immediately before you start a new load. However, if there is more water, we recommend checking the dishwasher filter, part number PS11759673. If this does not fix the issue, you may need to replace the control board, part number PS12745387. We hope this helps!",
      "Dishwasher drains but has standing water below filter after full cycle causing a rotten egg smell.  Drain line is clear.Hello Bryan, thank you for contacting us. It is normal for there to be a small amount of standing water in the dishwasher filter area. You may notice this water when you remove your dishwasher filters for regular cleaning. This small amount of water is drained when you start your next cycle and is replaced with fresh water. The smell might be due to a dirty drain filter. You may need to clean or replace the drain filter, part number PS11759673. We hope this helps.",
      "FLASHING DRAIN  LIGHT.  WATER IN BOTTON OF DISH WASHERHi Nancy, thank you for reaching out. The flashing drain light means that the washer is unable to drain water. To solve this issue, you may need to make sure first that the drain hose is not blocked. If that is not causing the issue, then you may need to check the drain pump, part number PS11738151. If it is faulty, you may need to replace it. We hope this information is useful!"

      "How do I locate the installation instructions on your web site for this part?Hello Bill,\n\nThanks for your question. Unplug the dishwasher and shut off your water supply before installation. Use a 5/8\" wrench to unthread the water supply line fitting from the shutoff valve. Water may spill out. Use a Phillips screwdriver to remove the screws at the lower access panel. Remove the screws securing the inner access panel. Lift up the panel to detach it. Remove the nuts and bolts securing the grounding wire to remove the panel. Remove the screws securing the junction box cover and pull it off. Take note of the wire locations and remove the wire nuts. Unthread the wire strain relief nut and detach the nut from the junction box. Disconnect the drain hose from the sink drain or garbage disposer and feed it through the cabinet. Open the dishwasher's door and remove the mounting bracket screws. You may need to adjust the legs to lower the appliance, then  carefully pull the dishwasher out of the cabinet. Open the door and slide out the lower rack. Use pliers to rotate the water panel grille counterclockwise and then remove it. Lift the insulation and remove the pressure hose from the water panel retaining clip. Break the clamp securing the water valve hose to the water panel and remove the hose. Release the spring clamp to remove the hose from the drain pump. Detach the two drain hose retaining clips and remove the clips from your hose. Pull the old drain hose free. Unthread the grille from the water panel and attach the drain hose to the new panel. Reverse this procedure to install the part.\n\nI hope this helps."

Ms Shaw ordered parts from you, just trying to be a good ex.Hi Jack, Thank you for the question. the two plastic parts go at the corners of the door. You will need to remove the door in order to remove the old parts and have them replaced. Hope this helps!",
      "How do you install lower door seal with adhesive to prevent leaking  seal can be put on two different ways so which way is correct?Hello, Thank you for your inquiry. Open up the dishwasher door and pull out the old seal. Then close the door and use a 1/4 inch nut driver to remove the lower access panels. Next you need to remove the two door springs, make note of which notch they are in, then push the spring down to push it off the rail. Bend the tap that holds the hinge onto the pin with a flat head screw driver right behind the tab and bend it up and out of the way so you can lift the pin out of the hinge to release them. Close the dishwasher door, you may want to put a towel down, then lift it off the hinges and set it on the floor. Remove the left and right tub spacers by lifting them out. Put in the new tub spacers by pushing them down into place. Then replace the door on the hinges. Lower it down, then bend the hinge tab back down so it closes the hinge pin in place enough so that it holds the hinge but doesn't restrict the movement of the hinge. When you put the lower seal on, you want to make sure that the little slot is where the bottom of the door goes into. Apply the adhesive carefully along the edge, then insert the seal into the bottom of the door. Close the door and then reach underneath to hook the door springs onto the rails back onto the notch you took them off of. Before you put the kick panels back on, you may want to run a load to make sure there is no leaks. Then re-attach the panels, starting with the lower one first, then the upper one and re-attach the screws. Hope this helps!",
      "Where do you apply the sealant?Hello Marg, thank you for your question. The Heat Resistant Adhesive part number PS11728058 can be applied to the Seal along the area that snaps into place on the door. Good luck with your repair!",
      "Do you happen to have a new video to replace the inner door seal. Al the videos are for the old style door. I have a one piece door with the operating buttons on the top edge of the door, so when it closes the buttons are not visible. There is only on plate that covers the very bottom. So this is long door version. Any videos i find on line are again for only the old style dishwasher.  If you need to see what i mean just look at my model which is not new by any manner. It is 10 yrs old.  I have just replaced the door gasket and that did not solve the problem of the leak on the right side of the door,  so i have just ordered the bottom inner door seal and that is where all the videos are for 20 + yr old dishwashers.  Please let me know if you can even provide written instructions i would appreciate it.

      "Kenmore 665.15982 dishwasher.  When in a number of wash program modes - as the program switches from washing to drain mode water pours out the bottom of the door - sounds washing and draining at the same time.  I cancel the program and manually select drain option - the water pouring out the bottom of the door stops and the water drains as normal.  This issue started all at once - not gradually.  Does the pump do both spraying and draining and potentially not switching between the two properly when in a program mode.Hello Dave, Thank you for your inquiry. Part# PS3500989 controls both the water circulation and draining. You can test this part with a multimeter to see if it is causing the problem. We also recommend checking the water inlet valve, the door switch, the float switch, and the float stem kit. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, we have videos available to assist you. Good luck with your repair."

It seems to be coming from teh recirculating pump as it does it as soon as the Dishwasher starts the cleaning cycle.\nIs this going to turn into a failure and should I change the pump before it breaks down ?\nThank you !Hello Mathieu, thank you for your question. We have researched the model you have provided, and we would suggest the Circulation Pump, part number PS11724988. If you need help placing an order, our customer service is open 7 days a week.

      "Hello, my dishwasher is making a rolling/grinding noise that appeared recently when the dishwasher is washing. I am certain it is coming from the circulation pump as the noise starts when the cleaning cycle begins. There is no noise when it is draining. Can you tell me if the circulation replacement pump is the 12008381. It looks extremely similar to the one in my machine. I have taken it out to inspect it.

      "Getting error code E09. Replaced door control board and still getting same code. Is this heat pump part the only other thing that could generate the e09 code. Definitely not heating or drying as before.Hi Keith, \n\nThank you for your question. The E09 error code means that your appliance is having a problem that is effecting your temperature. What you should do first is disconnect your appliance from the power for at least 5 minutes. Connect it again. If you still have the error code, unfortunately you would have to replace your electronic control board. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "I had error 09 and was told replacing the circulating pump ps11724988 would fix it. Now the error showing is e21. HelpHello Dave,\nThank you for your question. The error code E21 means there is a hard clog formed in the pump area. The blockage paralyzes the work of this part, making draining impossible or at least difficult. The impeller of the pump is damaged or worn out. Also, the E21 code can “pop out” if the impeller is clogged with large debris. We suggest unclogging any debris in the drain hose, and checking the impeller on the pump. We hope this helps!",
      "Er 2 shows on front panel-no heat.  No dry dishes.Have cleaned drain.Hello, Thank you for your question.  An E2 error indicates a problem related to the inlet cold water temperature sensor. The sensor may be sensing temperatures outside normal parameters or the sensor itself may be defective. We hope this helps.",
      "We have an E20 code. Will replacing this part be the fix?Hello Jeff, thank you for contacting us. According to our research, the E20 error is indicated when the circulation pump is faulty. We would recommend checking the circulation pump, part number PS11724988. You may also need to check the pump's resistance by using a multimeter. We hope this solves your problem!"

If you aren't getting any power we would recommend testing/replacing the door switch first. This part sends a signal to the board that the door is closed and if it doesn't work the unit will not power up. If the switch is tested/replaced and the unit still doesn't power up the issue could be the board, which is unfortunately, discontinued now. I hope this helps!",

      "What is the difference between control panel 1 and control panel 1a?Hi Greg,\n\nThank you for your question. This part is black while part 1a is white. Good luck with your repair.",
      "The panel control comes exactly with what parts?  It is the top of the door of the dishwasher, but it comes with all the controls and the box that is inside?  T he box where all the cables go to the main body of the dishwasher? Basically is just like take the old one and put the new one and that's it?  Thank you.Hello Jorge, thank you for your question. The panel control is the whole control/touch panel where all the different cycles are displayed, and you push the buttons to  make your selection. It also includes the ribbon connector cable that plugs into the control board. I hope this helps.",
      "My dishwasher won't start so i replaced the bi-metal fuse,that wasn't it.When i put control panel back on all lights lit up like a christmas tree and i can't turn them off.Do you have any thoughts on what it might be and how to fix.Thank you vernHello Vern, thank you for your question. It sounds like the issue is with the electronic control board. I would recommend replacing part number CNTRL-ELEC W11202746. I hope this helps!",
      "Does this control panel come in stainless? I am thinking of replacing the door panel & control panel with the stainless since my kitchen is stainless and my dishwasher is working perfectly.Hi Sally, \n\nThank you for your question. No, this panel only comes in Black and White. For a Stainless model you would need this panel, the black one. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "I need instructions to install I can not get inserts out.Hello Kathleen, Thank you for the question. You generally have to remove the gasket around your dishwasher door to reveal the screws that hold the back side of your door in place. Remove those screws. Remove the back side of your door. Remove any screws holding in the control panel. Put in your new control panel, reattach the parts and reverse the process to put your door back together. I hope this helps!",
      "All lights are working, however, pushing the soft, start button, will not start the cycle. Is this just the plastic panel or is there some electrical element? I am confused between this and the cnrl elec part.Hi Linda, thank you for your question. It could either be the Control Panel or the Electronic control board (which I have linked below for you). Unfortunately only a technician would be able to test these parts to tell you which one might be causing the issue. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Hello,\nI have this model of dishwasher. Most lights on the control panel can still be turned on and off except for normal cycle light. The reset button still works and is interrupted when i open the door. However, it is impossible to start the washing cycle by pressing start. Do you know which piece is involved?Hello David, Thank you for the question. You may need to remove the control panel to check for any visible damage.If the panel is good normally the control board will need to be replaced. PartSelect Number PS12349161. Hope this helps!",
      "No power on panel, but power is going to the box. I disconnect and reconnected and still  no power. The latch is broken ,so I removed pannel to test and still no power. If I replace control  panel  does  8t c9me with  latch as well.Hi Jason, thank you for your question. According to our research, a damaged or faulty bi-metal fuse, part number PS2360984, could be the reason your dishwasher has no power. Check the bi-metal fuse with a multi-meter for continuity. If the bi-metal fuse works, then you will need to replace the control board, part number PS12349161. The control board does not include the door latch. The door latch, part number PS11754317, can be ordered separately. Please submit a new question if you have any follow-ups.",
      "Can i purchase the plastic control panel, less all the components.  I only need the panel itself.  The handle fell off due to the plastic stud that the handle fastens to broken.  Per the drawing on the internet it looks like i would have toHello Alan, Thank you for your inquiry. You can only get the control panel as an assembly with the overlay and insert. Hope this helps!",
      "How hard is it to replace touch pad on a Maytag dishwasher?  Is it a dys item if you are handy and a know it allHi Peter,\n\nThank you for the inquiry. You would actually have to replace your whole control panel as the touch pad does not come separately from that plastic housing it is attached to. It is generally a pretty easy installation. You generally have to remove the gasket around your dishwasher door to reveal the screws that hold the back side of your door in place. Remove those screws. Remove the back side of your door. Remove any screws holding in the control panel. Put in your new control panel, reattach the parts and reverse the process to put your door back together.\n\nI hope this helps!"

Please let us know if you have further questions!",
      "My handle broke off of my white dish washer and I don’t see this part in another color is this what I need to order? And do I need to order the whole assembly? Do they come separately? Also I have never replaced it does it come with instructions?Hello Jamie. This is the correct assembly WPW10130695 for your white dishwasher, and it includes everything you need to replace the handle. To begin this repair, unplug your dishwasher or disconnect the power. You will want to remove the screws that are holding the inner door to remove the inner door panel. You will see wires leading to the old latch assembly, remove them and the assembly. Using the same steps but backwards you can connect the new assembly, put it back in place, and reattach the inner door panel. Good luck with this repair!",

Yes, the handle comes in an assembly with the latch (note that it is no longer available in white). You will need to replace the handle and latch assembly.\n\nI hope this helps.",
      "So my door latch is hanging from my dishwasher. And I cant open the door bc its locked. I read that I can lift the door up and jerk it. Sounds easy enough. BUT will I break anything if I do this? I dont want to jerk it open if it breaks something else.Hi David, great question. You are right, the only way to open a jammed door would be to lift the door and with controlled movements to jerk it outwards. Before attempting this, we recommend checking the dishwasher to make sure it is properly mounted so that the jerking movement does not slide it out of place and hurt the dishwasher. Otherwise, by doing this you will not be at risk for breaking anything. Just be careful and give yourself some space. I hope this helps.",

Checked float switch manually and it works but dishwasher doesn't fill enough for water to engage. Please help.Hello Jim, thank you for inquiring. This could be caused by either a faulty or defective Water Inlet Valve part PS259368, the Motor and Pump Kit part PS260801, or the Float Switch part PS260235. Try checking the water pressure to the valve. The water inlet valve requires at least 20 psi to function properly. We hope this helps.",

      "I have a the GE dishwasher model# gsd3400g00ww (serial# md848018b). It is 15 years old. It is not filling up with water all the way. I think my inlet water valve is clogged up. To keep from replacing it at this time: 1) can i, and is there, any type of solution  that i can run through this valve to clean it out without having to remove the valve from the washer? 2) if the valve has to be removed to clean it out, what is the best solution that i can make or buy to do the job easily? 3) what is it that usually clogs up this valve and or stops it from working? I am trying to not have to buy a new $55.00 valve. Please respond as soon as possible. Thank you very much.Hi Linda,\nThank you for your inquiry.  If your washer is not filling up with water, there are a few parts that you may have to look at.  The water inlet valve is one of them, but you may also have to look at the drain solenoid kit, the motor and pump kit, the float switch and the sump housing.  In regards to the water inlet valve, there really is no solution that you can use to clean it, however, there are screens on the valve where the hoses connect to where sediment and water particles build up.  You may want to remove the hoses from the valve to clean them to see if this will fix the issue.  I hope this helps with the repair.  Thank you and have a great day!",

I've read it could be a bad timer, but i can't find a timer part listed.   Would this part fix the problem?Hello Jeff, thank you for your question. There are a few parts we would recommend testing. You should test the float switch PartSelect Number: PS260235 and the drain solenoid Part Number: PS260117. If those parts are tested and are functioning correctly the issue could be the timer PartSelect Number: PS260202. I hope this helps.",

Power would have to be supplied for it to work correctly. It sounds as though the Water Inlet Valve is faulty. This part number PS259368 is the correct replacement for your model.

Is this repairable or does it need to be replaced?Hi Greg,\nThank you for your question.  If there is water leaking from the water inlet valve, you will need to replace it.  There is a video listed with the water inlet valve on our website that you may reference on how to install it.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "My dishwasher overflowed check the float switch it is good, how can i be sure i need to replace my inlet valve. ThanksHi Dean,\n\nThank you for your question. You would be able to test your water inlet valve with a multi meter to see if it is malfunctioning or not. When testing your valve, if your meter does not change at all that means that your part has no continuity and will need to be replaced. Good luck with your repair.",
      "The continuity reading on my intake valve is 1221-1234. From my quick online research that is moderate resistance but too high for this application. What is the range for adequate functioning of this part?Hi Miguel,\n\nThank you for your question. Actually your water inlet valve should show a reading between 500 - 1500 ohms. So with those readings, your valve is working fine. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Every time we close the door on our Frigidaire dishwasher it fills with water. It stops when the door is open. But will continuously fill with water anytime the door is closed. What could the problem be?Hello Lyman, thank you for your question. The first part you will want to check in this kind of situation is the water fill valve. It sounds like the water valve is stuck in an open position. Checking a water valve is very easy. Use your multitester to test the valve for continuity. Set the device to the ohms setting x 1. Touch each of the meter's probes to a terminal. If you receive a reading of infinity, it means the valve's solenoid is faulty and the valve needs to be replaced. If your valve has two solenoids (four terminals), test the second pair of terminals in the same manner. If either pair of terminals receives a result of infinity, replace the water inlet valve. You do not have to remove the water inlet valve from the dishwasher in order to test it. Just make sure power is not getting to your dishwasher before you conduct the test. If the valve is not faulty, the issue is most likely the control board, as that board is what runs the cycles on the unit and acts like a timer, it could be stuck in a fill setting The water valve for your appliance is part number 154637401 and the board is part number 154886103. I hope this helps!",
      "The dishwasher seems to be working and running full cycles however. No water is coming in. I have removed all traps and cleaned them out again. Still nothing. Could it be the inlet valve not allowing water in?Hello Lourdes, Thank you for the question. In most cases if no water is filling the tub, the water inlet valve would need to be replaced. Hope this helps!",

The manufacture has not stated there is a removable plug for the valve. You should be able to install it as is. Hope this helps!",
      "Why would the top not spin.Hi Jannell,\nThank you for your question.  If the upper spray arm is not turning, then it is likely clogged with debris and it will need to be cleaned.  To clean the spray arm, remove it from the dishwasher and place it in a solution of dishsoap, 1 cup of vinegar and warm water and let it soak until the debris has loosened.  If there are mineral deposits from hard water, soak it in vinegar. Use an old toothbrush, or other scrubbers to clean the surfaces of the arm. Also, use toothpicks or some other tool that you can use to remove any build up from the holes.  Once the arm has been thoroughly cleaned, reattach it inside the dishwasher.  We hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day."

      "Does this part include the tine & the tine holder?Hi June, Thank you for the question. This is the Dishrack Only, the wheels, tines and holders are sold sepratly. Good luck with the repair!",
      "Is the rack complete (ie) wheels,clips,ect.?Hi Ted, Thank you for the question. The description states this is the Dishrack only, so the wheels and clips and other connecting parts are sold sepratly. Hope this helps!",
      "Is there a replacement for the lower dishrack?  The photo does not appear to match the rack that is in my dishwasher.Hi John, thanks for the question. This lower dish rack should work with your model (KUDK03ITBL2). Feel free to watch our installation video for help replacing the rack, should you require it. I hope this helps with your repair.",
      "The picture shown is the correct model lower rack for my kitchenaide dishwasher original number was wp8519681 for part. As i read everywhere else, this rack is discontinued and the replacement is rectangle in shape with squared off edges. The correct one has a cutout on the right front corner for the small silverware basket that latches onto the outside of the rack - completing the square edge, the inner silverware basket is therefore shorter than most because of the cutout, also my rack has two sets of adjustable tines, the replacement has only one adjustable tine - so are you sure that this is a new old stock oem basket with the cutout on front right side or is it squared off like all the other replacements from all the other parts distributors?  In other words is the photo correct or outdated from what you are actually selling??Hello Chirs, thank you for your question. The lower rack for your appliance model number has been substituted quite a few times. Now this rack is a basic square rack, that has the front two corners \"cut off\" to create an angle on the front corners. It would not come with tines, or rollers. The rollers would have to be ordered separately. This is the only replacement rack that the manufacturer offers as a replacement for the original rack. The picture online, and the video are from an older version of the rack that has since been discontinued. I hope this helps!",
      "Does the actual rack that i will get have a front right hand corner cutout (as pictured) for the detachable side cutlery basket like on the original model or is the replacement a square rack with no cutout.  The square replacement still fits both long and small cutlery basket but fits very oddly and is awkward in the rack itself, so want to be sure before i order and pay.Hi Jamie,\nThank you for your question.  Yes, there is in area on the lower dishrack that is available for you to set a silverware basket in.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "Does the rack replacement include all 4 wheel assembly's?  All 4 of mine are broken and it seems cheaper to buy a whole new rack.Hi Molly, Thank you for the question. According to the description, this is the Dish Rack only.Hope this helps!",
      "Do you offer a complete lower rack assy with wheels and all components ready to slip into dishwasher ????Hi Robert,\nThank you for your question.  Sadly, not for this model.  You will need to transfer the rollers and other components from the old lower dishrack to the new one.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "Does this rack work for this model #?Hi Amy,\n\nThank you for your question. Yes, this would be the correct part for your appliance. Good luck with your repair.",

      "I need only the adjustable tine.Hi Peter, \nThank you for your question.  The part number listed under your model number for the tine row is PS10057161.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

Is the universal silver and white the same except for color, the white is$132 and the silver is $232. ThanksHello Denis, thank you for your question. With all the other parts that were replaced, the only other option would be the control panel. Check the connection between the control touch panel and the board to be sure its a tight fit, and the ribbon connector isn't damaged or broken. If the touch pad lights are not working, and the connector isn't loose we would recommend replacing the control touch panel. The difference in prices are the different colors. white is Part #: PS11723001 and universal silver is Part #: PS11723003. Good luck with your repair.",

Turn the filter until it stops moving, with the tabs released. Pull the filter out of the dishwasher.\n\nPut the new filter in by setting it into the opening, possibly turn it a bit. Then turn it clockwise to lock it in. Put the lower rack back in by setting it on the door and sliding it in. Close the door, plug in the dishwasher again.\n\nI hope this helps.",

Not always mind you, as sometimes we have had a complete cycle go through with no problems. I'm stumped. Any advice? Control board maybe?

      "The water is leaking from part 71.  How do you get it out and put it back?  There is an electric wire attached to the bottom of the red stopper thing.Hi Era,\nThank you for your question.  Before you begin any repair please unplug the appliance from the electrical outlet and turn off the dishwasher's water supply.  The turbidity sensor is mounted on the sump and tells the control board how dirty the water is so it can adjust the cycles.  You will need to pull the dishwasher out to do the repair.  You will need to disconnect the lines.  First you will need to remove the dishwasher drain line.  Have towel handy in case any water comes out.  You will also need to remove the fill line attached to the hot water tap.  Once you have this done, you can open the dishwasher door and take the bottom rack out.  Then remove the screws that the dishwasher to the countertop.  Once the screws are removed, You can pull the dishwasher out of the cabinet and lay it down on its back.  Be sure to lay a blanket or towel down before you lay it down in case any water comes out of the dishwasher.  Once the dishwasher is on it's back, you will now have access to the bottom of the dishwasher and the turbidity sensor.  It is mounted on the sump just under the drain pump.  Remove the wiring harness attached to the sensor by pressing on the locking tab to release it.  To get the sensor out of the sump you will need to turn it counter-clockwise and then pull it out.  To install the new sensor and reinstall the dishwasher under the counter follow the steps in reverse and once the dishwasher has been reinstalled turn the water back on and plug the power back in and the dishwasher should work now for you.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",

Do you think it could come  from the turbidity sensor, or any other piece ?\nThank you for your helpHello Remi, thank you for reaching out. Based on our understanding of the issue, we would suggest checking the drain hose and pump filter. If they are not clogged, then you may need to replace the control board, part number PS8689436, to fix the issue. We hope this helps."

      "Does not respond to start button.  All other lights working. Does not runHi Richard, thank you for your question. There are actually a few parts that might cause this issue. You should take a look at your door latch, your control panel (the part with the buttons), and your control board (the brain of your appliance that the buttons activate). I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "The only cycle buttons that work are power plus and start. Is this a touchpad issue?Hello Dave, Thank you for the question. If some buttons work and others do not, it is most likely the touch pad, Part Number: PS2379423. Hope this helps, good luck with this repair!",
      "We had a power surge during a storm. Now our dishwasher has no power. I'm guessing we need a new control panel. Is this correct?Hello Paula, thank you for inquiring. This is most likely due to a faulty Electronic Control Board, but we will need the model number for your dishwasher to locate the correct replacement for it. W10632077A is not recognized as a model number. We look forward to hearing back from you!",
      "Dishwasher is dead.  Like it's getting no power (although plugged in and the outlet works.) when the problem started, the start/cancel light was on & wouldn't respond to commands.  When i unplugged / plugged back in, no light, no response, just dead, dead, dead.  Wondering how i can be confident it would only be a control panel issue, or if more parts like pc board could be the problem.  I don't want to sink $$ into the problem, only to find out there's more to fix.  Thanks!Hi Doug,\n\nThank you for your question. I would suggest testing your door switches. It could be that they have failed. When you close your dishwasher door and the switches activate, they allow power to go to your board. So they may have failed. You can test them with a multi meter to check. If they are fine though, it may be your electronic control board that is the issue. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "My dishwasher can only be started with the energy saver button all other cycle buttons do not work.  Will replacing the control/touch panel likely fix this?Hello David, Thank you for your inquiry. You can test the control panel with a multimeter to see if it has continuity. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, there are YouTube videos available to assist you. If it doesn't, then replace the control panel. Hope this helps!",
      "We have power to control panel and dishwasher. Can select a cycle but the start/cancel button is not responding at all. Initially was able to get it to start with persistence but nothing now. Sound like a control panel issue?Hello Megan, thank you for your question. If the other cycle buttons are working except for the start/cancel button the issue would be with the Touchpad and Control Panel 5304475578 or the PC BOARD ASSEMBLY 5304475571. The PC board should be tested before ordering parts as it is often misdiagnosed and requires electrical testing with a volt/ohm meter to determine if it is defective! I hope this helps!"

It would seem that a piece of debris from mineral deposits may be stuck in the inlet water valve. The opening in the valve is very small and minerals may become lodged in there and cause a slow leak of the water into the dishwasher tub. You can look inside the dishwasher at where the water enters the tub to see of there's a very slow leak. When things are working correctly (inlet valve not leaking) it should be dry. If you see any water coming in, then the Inlet Valve is leaking. Replacment is the best option in this case. PartSelect Number PS259369",

There is no way to take the lower spray arm apart.  If the lower spray arm is clogged, try soaking it in a solution of warm water and vinegar and use a fine pin to remove any blockages from the spray holes.

This issue can be caused by one of the spray arms hitting something as the dishwasher is washing. Check the middle and lower spray arms for any obstructions or loose connections. We also recommend checking the door springs, the door balance kit, and the pump and motor assembly. We hope this helps and if you need help placing an order, customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you!",
      "Dishwasher is leaking from the bottom of the door.  Have replaced the lower door seal and the inlet control valve. Set the front to back level so that it is slightly inclined to the rear. Reduced the amount of the water leaking but did not eliminate it. Next will replace the lower wash arm. If the leak still persists do you have any ideas or is it time to call a repair technician? Thanks.Hi David, thank you for the question. If you find the dishwasher leaking from the bottom of the door, a clogged drain is usually the reason. Located at the base of the dishwasher, food particles, soap residue, and other debris can cause clogs that prevent water from draining. A clogged drain can lead to puddling inside the dishwasher that eventually leaks out the bottom of the door. If that is not causing the issue and the lower spray arm does not solve the problem, then you may need to check the overflow control switch, part number PS11750031. If it is faulty, you may need to replace it. We hope this helps!"

      "Would damage to the striker be that it is at the wrong angle to connect with the latch?  In the video, i could see that the striker was at angle from the horizontal end, but couldn't see how much of an angle.  I guess i need to know the degrees of that bend.  Gotta get this worked out, dishes are piling up!   Yes, i know i could wash them by hand, but, isn't that why i have a dishwasher?   KHi K,\n\nThank you for your question. Unfortunately we would not have the information on the angle of the part. However if you take a look at the third photo of the part that we have on the site, that would indicate what the angle should be. However, if your door strike was bent at the wrong angle, you more than likely would not even be able to close your door. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

      "Hi, I have a leaking drain hose, I have my part, but do not know how to access the area where the drain hose connects. Looks like I have to take off the short aluminium side panel, then? Is this correct?Hi Joseph,\nThank you for your question.  To access/install the drain hose, the left hand panel will have to be removed. Remove the 2 screws in the front left trim panel and the friction clip at the top back then slide up and off. This will reveal the o-ring drain hose connection point. You need to remove the retainer block where the hose exits the appliance. The old hose will pull out and you will be able to push the new hose through. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",

Either way, you will have to replace the part. Good luck with your repair.",

      "Replaced the soap/rinse aid dispenser the soap portion is working fine but the rinse aid only worked for a short period. Any suggestions as to what may be preventing the rinse aid portion from dispensing. Have tried all settings 1 through 6Hi Greg,\nThank you for your question.  The detergent dispenser is designed to release detergent into the dishwasher tub during the wash cycles and will typically have two compartments, an unsealed compartment for prewash and a sealed compartment for the main wash cycle. Verify that the dispenser is not simply clogged with caked on detergent and give it a good cleaning if necessary. Also check to make sure that the cover for the dispenser will open easily and is not damaged or broken. Check the release mechanism for worn or defective parts and replace if necessary. The rinse aid dispenser is designed to release rinse aid into the tub during the rinse cycle. Verify that the dispenser is full and is not clogged with detergent and verify that the cap is adjusted properly. The dispensers may be operated by either a mechanical devise or by a bi-metal release or wax motor devise.  Also, The rinse aid cap could be the reason why your dishwasher is not releasing rinse aid. The rinse aid dispensing cap is located on the inner door panel of your dishwasher. The rinse aid cap could be loose and may just need to be refitted, but could also be warped or damaged from the heat of the water in the dishwasher. Remove the cap from the door and inspect it for signs of melting or warping and replace if need be.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",

This part is attached to the bottom of your dishwasher inner door panel. It is frequently exposed to water and detergent during its lifetime. The water and chemicals can eventually wear down the gasket and compromise the integrity of the seal. If the gasket is malfunctioning, the integrity of the door seal will be effected. You will notice leaking through the bottom of your dishwasher door. If your dishwasher is leaking water from the bottom of the door, first inspect the seal for food particles near the bottom and sides, and remove the buildup, as it can stop the door from closing properly and keeping a tight seal; if not, you may need to replace the bottom door gasket. Check the door gasket for tears, cuts, or wear. This part is sold individually and measures 22.5 inches by 1.25 inches. It is constructed of plastic, and comes in yellow/grey. Includes one lower door gasket.\n",

      "So I’m trying to do this repair myself and although I think I got it right I’m not sure and it’s very frustrating. Here’s the problem, after I change the gasket seal just barely touching it will slip it out. How do I stop this from happening, do I have the wrong part or was I supposed to get some sort of glue or clip thing? The notch is on the right side that was indicated in the video too. Can you help me?Hi Helena, based on your situation we recommend pressing the gasket with controlled pressure into the channel that is on the inner door liner. It should be a snug fit, and if it is too loose it needs to be pushed in further. I hope this helps.",
      "Bottom door gasket, pulled out the old one, very easy, cleaned the space where gasket goes. Started on the side with notch, pushed in then started pushing in from notch across, gasket then disappeared and i can not see it. How do i recover the gasket?Hello Robert, Thank you for your inquiry. You may have to remove the inner door panel or liner in order to pull the gasket out. We also have an installation video to install the gasket. https://www.partselect.com/PS9495545-Frigidaire-809006501-Bottom-Door-Gasket.htm#RepairVideo\n Hope this helps!",

I am asking about a notch that is in the middle of the gasket. I have got this part before and had the same thing. It does not show on your picture of the item or on the installation video. It is about 1/4 inch square. What is it and will it let the door leak. Don't see a reason for it.Hi Gary,\n\nThank you for your question. That is just how the part is made. You do not have to worry about it. Your appliance should not leak because of that notch. Good luck with your repair.",
      "My dishwasher is leaking from the lower left corner of the door. Where do I start?Hello Cece, we recommend checking your lower door seal 809006501 for damage. The door seal is the most common reason for leaking, and it is a replacement part that experiences a lot of wear. Best of luck with this repair.",
      "I'm looking for the bottom door gasket. Your video shows installing a white gasket on what appears to be a somewhat flexible interior.  I'm wondering if that gasket will work on our Frigidaire professional series dishwasher.  Or do i need a different bottom door gasket.Hello Leslie, thank you for contacting us. The correct bottom door seal for your model is PS1150945. Good luck with your repair!",
      "Bottom door gasket has 6 holes and water leaks through the holes. Was sent a replacement from Frigidaire and it has the same holes.

I found your model number on one of resource sites and the image of the gasket shows that it does have 6 holes.  The manufacturers part number I found under your model number is different from the one you have referenced in your question to us.  The part number I have found is 5304500204 (our part number for it is PS11703834). Frigidaire may have provided you with the wrong part.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "I have twice purchased bottom seal for door and both times they have come with a notch in the middle. This isn't shown in any video on replacement of gasket. Why is this?Hi Gary,\n\nThank you for your question. There is a little tab on the bottom edge of your door that that notch slides over to give you your water tight seal. Good luck with your repair.",

      "I’m getting a leaking from my dishwasher but I already replaced the seals. What should my next plan of action beHello Miles, we recommend first checking that the dishwasher is levelled and properly secured. Then check that the door aligns with the tub opening, and that the splash guard does not have any damage. If everything is in good condition, check the float for sticking, and the spray arm for splitting. One of these should solve your problem. However, if you are still having leakage, please let us know and we will help you solve it.",

The seals are not sold separately and you would need to replace the full sump. Good luck with the repair.",
      "My Whirlpool dishwasher is completely functional, it just leaks around the diverter motor shaft. The diverter motor gets wet, but hasn't failed yet because of it. I don't see any reference to the seal that the shaft goes through. Can you help me?Hi Jeff, Thank you for the question. The seal you need is part of the Sump,PartSelect Number PS11755006. The seals are not sold sepratly and you would need to replace the full sump. Good luck with the repair!",
      "Dish washer leaks from the diverter valve assembly when the pump turns on. Am I correct in assuming after reading multiple answers/replies that the most likely cause is the shaft \"seal\" located in the sump assembly and not the actual diverter valve assembly itself. Also, the sump assembly looks like a real chore to replace. Thanks, JoeHi Joe, Thank you for the question. Yes, the seal that is in the sump that seals the motor shaft would most likely be the issue. The seal is not sold on its own so the sump will need to be replaced, PartSelect Number: PS11755006. Most customers have been able to do the repair on their own and have been able to locate some youtube videos for guidance. Hope this helps!",

I assume the diverter motor is shot as it appears ceased as i cannot get it to turn. Does this seem like a logical problem?Hi Doug,\n\nThank you for your question. Yes it could be your diverter valve. I would also suggest checking for any blockages to your manifold as well. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",

      "I am having problems with water coming out under my diverter motor.  I have taken the whole unit apart and could not find anything that looked faulty.  The shaft gasket looks alright and the diverter unit and shaft looks and operates fine.  What is wrong!  The water is dripping right under the diverter motor shaft.  But the gasket looks fine.  What should i do?Hello Andrew, thank you for your question. Unfortunately, even though the gasket might look OK, it could still be leaking, or the motor shaft could be slightly bent. The gasket is unfortunately not sold on its own. The gasket is only available with the sump part number PS11755006. I hope this helps!",

      "My dishwasher is not getting hot. The water going in is hot but it doesn't seem to be hot inside during the running cycle. I put it on high temp and heat dry to no avail. Heating element? Also, the little red button on the back of hose that connects to the faucet, when i draw water from it while dishwasher is running, it isn't hot water either.Thank you!Hello Ashley, thank you for contacting us. It could be the high limit thermostat, it could also be the heating element. You can test these with a multi meter. Good luck with the repair!",
      "How can you tell if the high limit thermostat is not working  and how can you check it to see if it is bad thanksHello Frank, Thank you for the question. The thermostat should read closed at room temp. You can test this with a multi-meter. Hope this helps!",
      "I have water to the machine and it starts and seems to run ok but is not cleaning well. I do not seem to have good cleaning pressure. I have cleaned all the filters and spray arms and changed the water inlet valve.Hi Brad, Thank you for the question. The drain hose may not have a loop in it. The fill water may be draining out of the dishwasher by going straight out the drain hose. Be sure that your drain hose is not simply laying straight. It must have a loop in it or be off the ground so the water is not gravity fed out via the drain hose. You can also try to empty the dishwasher, set it to run a wash cycle. Let it fill with water as normal. When the dishwasher begins the cycle, open the door and see if the water level is just under the heating elements.If there is not enough water there may be a clog in your water fill line. Remove the fill hose where it attaches to the fill valve. Check to be sure there is nothing clogging the screen on the inlet fill valve. Also check the water fill line for blockage. You can also check the Overfill Control Switch if it is not filling with water at the correct level. If it is defective it can shut the water flow off too soon. Hope this helps!",
      "My dishwasher water does not get hot.  We have tested the heating element and the high limit thermostat with a multimeter and they are both functional.  What else could it be?Hello Drew, Thank you for your inquiry. I would also check the bi-metal fuse/thermal fuse, door switch-and wires going from it to the control board, and the control board itself. Hope this helps!",
      "Sanitize light blinking at end of wash cycle. Heating element bad? Thermostat?  Water entering machine is above 120f prior to start.Hi Josey,\n\nThank you for the question, the flashing sanitize light indicates it did reach the sanitize temperature of 140-155 degrees in the final rinse. You can try running the hot water in the adjoining sink to get the hot water up to max temperature before starting the dishwasher. If this does not help try opening the door a bit during the wash cycle to see if there is steam indicating the water is hot. If the water is not getting hot then you may need to replace the heating element. \n\nHope this helps!",
      "Thank you for the respond, are you referring to thermal fuse part #: W10344801? Isn't this part to  shut the dishwasher off if the dishwasher shorts out or overheats? RegardsHi Bahman, Thank you for the question. This part is used as a safety device to protect the dishwasher circuit from overload. If the temperature gets to high it will shut off the electrical current to the heating unit in the appliance. Hope this helps!",
      "I've replace the high limit theromastad and the door lock control. It wants to start you can hear water going into machine but then nothing happens. Any ideas of the possible problem.Hello Richard, thank you for your question. If there is water getting into the unit but the appliance will not start the cycle you will want to test the motor to see if it has failed. If the motor is fine, the issue would be with the electronic board which would have to be replaced. I hope this helps!",
      "My dishwasher won't run and i think the switches are both fine.  If the high limit thermostat is bad will it prevent the machine from running at all or just affect the operation or heating?Thanks.Hi John, \nThat is a good question.  It may cause the situation you are describing.  Another part that may fix the issue could be the door switch kit as well.  You may need to contact Whirlpool for more information.  Their telephone number is 1-866-698-2538.  I hope this helps.  Thanks and have a great day!",
      "My jenn air dishwasher does not heat the water during the wash cycle.  I test the  heating element by running a function called plate warmer and it works fine , the element gets very hot.  I pulled out the  high limit thermostat and attach the digital volt meter and it shows continuity (normal closed). Can i test to see if i apply heat to it opens up and digital meter read open? What is causing the water not heat during the cycle?Hi Bahman,\n\nThank you for your question. Well, if both your heating element and your thermostat are testing that they are working, then the only other parts to check would be your bi metal fuse, and your electronic control board. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "My heating element snapped in half so i replaced it, but the element never seemed to kick on. The dishes are soaking wet and there are suds in the bottom of the dishwasher, which has never happened before. I am assuming that whatever is wrong must have snapped the element in half. Could the high limit thermostat cause the heating element to never come on?Hello Chris, Thank you for your inquiry. Since the high limit thermostat will shut down the heating element once it reaches a certain temperature, it could be causing the issue. You can test it with a multimeter to see if it has continuity. I would also double check the wiring going to the heating element for any visible damage. Hope this helps!"

Before you begin any repair please unplug turn the circuit breaker off for the dishwasher.  Once the power to the dishwasher has been tuned off, your first step will be open the door all the way and to remove the screws securing the control panel and pull the panel off.  Depress the tabs to release control board cover.  Use a flat head screw driver to release the tab through the bottom of the panel.  Detach the ribbon connector and use a screwdriver to detach the tab to release the control board.  Depress the tabs to release the door latch assembly and remove the old control panel and touchpad.  You can nor install the new control panel and touchpad.  Follow the steps in reverse and once everything has been reinstalled, restore power to the dishwasher.  Your dishwasher should now work for you.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

    "Product_Description": "\nDrum Glide Specifications\nIf your dryer is noisy, will not tumble, or is leaving marks on your clothes, you may need to replace the drum glide. The drum glide is installed on the front bulkhead either at the top or the bottom, regardless of the brand of dryer. To gain access to the drum glide, you will have to open the cabinet on the dryer. This drum glide is sold individually but it is important to note that they should be replaced in pairs. Before beginning this repair, it is important to disconnect the dryer from the power source. The tools required for this repair are a putty knife and a 5/16 nut driver.\n",

What is most likely the problem?Hello Tim, Thank you for the question. This is most likely causes by a defective Circulation Pump Motor, PartSelect Number PS11750859. This pump circulates the water up into the arms causing them to spin. If the pump is not pumping the top arms will not spin and the bottom will not have enough water pressure to spin at the proper rate. Hope this helps!",

When activated, the drain pump pushes the wastewater through the drain hose and into the household plumbing system or garbage disposal.

Do you have assembly drawings that show what all the numbered parts in the diagram are? Thanks in advanceHello Stephen, Thank you for the question. The clicking sounds like the control board trying to send the signal to the defective pump to start.

It won't do anything else with the cycle and then eventually just turns off. Does this sound like the drain pump?Hi Carmen, thank you for your question. Yes, it sounds like you might want to check your drain pump for being the problem. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "My drain pump is not responding, i am ordering a new one should i replace any related parts at the same time ie drain hose etc\nThxHello David, thank you for writing. You may also want to consider the Drain Hose part PS2358130 and the Drain Hose part PS11756139 for your model.",
      "My dishwasher will not start the clean cycle. There is standing water in the base of the wash area. It is making an intermittent clicking/grinding sound a few times then it goes into cancel/drain mode before turning itself off. Does this mean the drain motor is jammed/failed?Hi Brian,\nThank you for your question.  If you have standing water in the bottom of your dishwasher, there is likely food debris trapped in the filter or the pump preventing the water from draining.  You will need to inspect these parts and clean them of any debris.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "I have a small amount of water standing in the filter bowl. The dishwasher smells, does not clean well,  and does not complete the drying cycle. Any thoughts? I assume the pump is not working properly clearing the dirty waterHello Arthur, Thank you for the question. The first thing we suggest trying to cleaning the filter, pump and hoses to be sure there is no debris slowing the draining processes and leaving water behind. We hope this helps!",
      "My dishwasher would not drain no noises, cleaned the drain filter and put it back. Ran the dishwasher with no dishes in it and it drained very good. Put dishes in and ran it the 2nd time and did not drain. I removed all water, cleaned everything, put liquid plumber in dishwasher and garbage disposal have not run yet to see results.Hello Bruce, Thank you for the question. If the Liquid Plumber does not fix the issue, we suggest checking the drain pump and hose for any blockage or clogs. If they are clear, you may have a defective Drain Pump. You can also check the Sump for any blockage as well before replacing the Pump. We hope this helps!",
      "I would like to know if we can get a replacement impeller for the drain pump rather then replacing the entire pump since the pump is still working? ThanksHello Wally, Thank you for the question. Very sorry, the parts to the Pump are not sold separate from the Pump. Whirlpool only sells the impeller as part of the Drain Pump Assembly. If you need help placing an order, customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you!"

If not, you can remove the hinge arm link by simply disconnecting it from the hinge and spring, then replacing it with the new part. The hinge arm link is a small piece of white plastic about an inch and a half long. It is sold individually, and is an OEM part from the manufacturer.\n",

      "The door is not shutting all the way.Also it doesn't lay flat when door is opened i was told the spring was bad and needed to be replaced i have had this dishwasher a long time with no problems ever . Does that sound like the correct diagnosis? Thank youHi Judy,\nThank you for your question.  If your dishwasher door is not shutting correctly, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check hinges, the springs and the hinge arm links.  We hope this helps!  Good luck with the repair!"

The sensor wire is able to be taped to the inside of the door.\n\nI hope this helps.",

The dishes do not dry totally so I am thinking it is because there is no rinse agent.  I have been using the tablets with the little ball but they don't help.Hello Alice,\n\nThanks for your question.

I certainly hope i can get just the seal because as far as i can tell only the seal is bad. Thank you, mikeHi Michael, Thank you for the question. Very sorry but the seal is not sold separately from the dispenser its self. Hope this helps!",

It is made of gray plastic and is approximately 5 inches by 2 inches. The carrier roller supports the wheels on your upper dish rack so it can slide in and out of the dishwasher efficiently. This part has been redesigned by the manufacturer. This part can now be used on the right or left side of the rack.  Because it is made of plastic, the roller can occasionally crack and break, and when this occurs, it will need to be replaced. If you notice that your dish rack is having difficulty sliding in and out, you should check to see if the roller is damaged. This is an OEM part from the manufacturer and it is sold individually. The roller itself, is replacement part number WD12X26146. The cover is no longer needed when replacing the rack carrier kit.\n",

      "The water on our ice maker isnt shutting off and runs water into the ice bucket eventually creating a huge block of ice. We replaced the water inlet valve but it's still doing the same thing.Hi Vanessa,\n\nThank you for your question.

      "The ice maker is not making ice...  there doesn't seem to be any water coming to ice maker.  there water dispenser in the refrigerator portion is working properly.  thank youHi Victoria,\n\nThank you for your question. I would suggest testing your water inlet valve. The valve has two solenoids, one for your water inlet valve and one for your ice maker. It could be that the solenoid for your ice maker might be malfunctioning. You can test your part with a multi-meter. This test is fairly simple, all you have to do is set you multi-meter to the lowest setting. The calibrate it until the needle is on zero. You will then take each prob to the terminals inside of the plugs for each of your water inlet valve's solenoids. If the solenoid is reading 500 - 1500 ohms, then your valve is fine. However if your reading is close to or stays on zero, you will have to replace your valve. Also check your fill tube as well, it could be that there is an ice build up in the tube and it is blocking water from getting to your ice maker. I hope this helps you. Good luck with your repair.",

It sounds like a tapping or clicking… not a normal freezer sound.Hello Jasper, unfortunately if your icemaker is making a clicking sound, that is a sign that it needs replacing. You can order that here D7824706Q. As for the installation process, it is not a difficult repair. You will need to remove a few screws, unplug the wires to the assembly, and attach the new one.

      "The ice maker in the freezer section of my Jenn-Air (your website says manufacturer part number d7824706q- the data plate inside the fridge says part number uki2500axx) ) is leaking water into the ice pan. The ice maker works, it makes ice, the bail works but i am getting a block of ice forming in the ice pan every few days. I looked under the ice mold when water was running in from fill cup and it appears that water is leaking along the front edge of the mold and  i suspect the ice maker needs to be replaced (it's 13 years old.) also, i am finding a glaze of ice on the floor of the freezer and, occasionally (once or twice a week), a small puddle of water on the floor under the fridge. It appears to me that water is working its way down through the freezer from the ice maker because i' have found ice on top of food items on the shelves as well. The ice maker looks like it would be easy to replace based on internet research and your website. I am wondering about the occasional puddle of water on the floor and whether the water inlet valve should also be replaced or if the water from inside the freezer is working it's way to the outside. Based on your opinion I'll order parts to replace the ice maker. Thanks.Hi Rick, Thank you for the question. When the ice maker is leaking it can cause the puddle you are getting. I suggest replacing the ice maker first as it will need to be replaced to fix the block of ice in the ice cube pan and see if that fixes the issue. You can also remove the backing from the appliance and take a rag, wrap it around the valve and check it after 24 hours to see if it is wet. Hope this helps!",
      "Why is my ice maker leaking ? I took it out ,its not cracked and sometimes it stopped leaking for a bit then started leaking again.Hi Vincent,\n\nThank you for your question. I would suggest figuring out where your leaking is coming from first. If it is coming from below the ice maker tray, then it is likely you will need to replace your ice maker. However if the leaking is happening because the tray is being over filled with water, you should test your water inlet valve with a multi meter to see if it is working correctly. It could be that the solenoid for your ice maker has failed. If your valve is fine, you will  need to replace your ice maker. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "My icemaker is over flowing and running right out of the freezer door. I feel like the water is not shutting off properly and the tray is over flowing which is causing the running water. Does this sound right? If so, what’s the most likely culprit?Hi Lucy, we recommend checking your water valve 12001414 for damage. A faulty water valve is most likely the cause in this case. Best of luck with this repair!",
      "I recently replaced the water inlet valve and I still have no water going to the ice maker. Do I need to replace the ice maker?Hi Gary, Thank you for the question. If the valve did not fix the issue then the icemaker is not telling the valve when it send water to fill the icemaker. To fix this the icemaker will need to be replaced. Good luck with the repair!",
      "We installed the new ice maker and it’s not filling with water. Does it take awhile for it to cycle and fill.  I know everything else was working except the ice maker beforeHi Marge,\nThank you for your inquiry.  Once a new ice maker is installed, it can take up to 24 hours for the ice maker to start making ice.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "When the ice cubes from my automatic ice maker melt, they release small white flakes of flocculant material that settles to the bottom of the glass.  The cartridge water filter is only 4 months old, and the 'replace filter' light is not illuminated.  The water coming from the chilled water dispenser does not have the white flakes.  Does the water for the ice maker go through the cartridge filter?  Any idea what the problem/source might be for the flakes in the ice cubes?     Thanks.  \\kmHi Kim,\nThank you for your inquiry.  The white flakes that are appearing in your ice are caused by calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate which are found in hard water.  Calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate are harmless, but if you want perfect, flake-free ice cubes, you will need to soften your water.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

      "What are causes for not drainingHello Roger, Thank you for your inquiry. The drain hoses could be clogged or cracked, the drain pump may not be working properly, the drain/check valve flapper could be broken, the sump filter could be clogged, or the impeller and seals could be cracked. Hope this helps!",
      "Has not completely drained tub, and will not start to fill if you recycle it.Hello Mark, thank you for your question. I would recommend checking the Check Valve Flapper\nfor any cracks and damage and make sure it's not stuck closed. Make sure there are no clogs or cracks in the drain hoses. You can also test the pump with a multimeter to see if it has continuity. A normal pump should read about 200 ohms when you are testing it. If the unit will not fill with water, you should check the Water Inlet Valve Part Number: WD15X10003. I hope this helps!",
      "My dishwasher stopped spraying water from above, so it does not wash. What part can be defective?Hi Maria,\nThank you for your question.  If the top sprayer is not spraying water, it may be clogged.  You will need to inspect the part to see if there is any debris in it.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

      "It seems my 18\" wide Frigidaire dishwasher has a door spring problem as the door flops down when i open it. Do you have instructions on how to replace it? Does it take special tools?Hello Michele, thank you for your question. The door spring for your model is part number 154237401 and the plastic bushing that you probably need as well is part number 154671501. This is a very easy repair. The unit should be pulled out from under the counter (which can mean you have to shut off the water and disconnect power). Once the unit is pulled out you will see the door hinges and spring at the bottom front corners. The springs hook into the hinges and are supported by the bushing pad which slides down into the hook that is on the hinge. There may be some installation videos online for you in case you need some help. There are no special tools required. I hope this helps!",
      "Are there 2 door springs on this model?Thanks!Hello Rod, Thank you for the question. Yes, the appliance requires 2 door springs. Thank you for your inquiry, good luck with this repair!"

      "Hello I have a dishwasher that does not wash dishes. In fact when I open the door I see that the soap has dropped out of the soap dispenser and is just sitting in the washer. No cleaning. The repair guy told me something about a motor failure. If I purchased replaced the pump motor assembly unit, would that fix the problem or should I go for another smaller part? Where should I start?Hello Bright, Thank you for the question. This sounds like the Dishwasher Pump and Motor Assembly is not circulating the water up tot he spray arms allowing the water to spray onto the dishes to clean them. We hope this helps!",
      "The sprayers inside of my dishwasher aren't working, i've cleaned out the drains and it still does not work.  What part would i need to get the sprayers working again?Hello Jason, thank you for your question. We would recommend testing/replacing the diverter motor first, PartSelect Number PS5136127. The diverter motor moves the diverter disc into position so the disc can direct water through the upper spray arms. If the diverter motor is fine the issue could be the circulation pump PartSelect Number PS12070585. I hope this helps!",
      "Dishwasher is 2 yrs. old.  Water goes in but cycle hangs up after that and just sits there without water spraying around.  No noise during this time.  Able to drain water using the button on the front so that pump seems to be working.Hi Debbie, thank you for reaching out. You may need to replace the circulation pump, part number PS16744934. We hope this helps!",
      "Kicks the breaker when plug into the power reception socket.Hello Frank , Thank you for your inquiry. A Kenmore dishwasher will trip your breaker when there is excessive current detected in the dishwasher’s circuits, usually caused by damaged wires or parts. Check the internal wiring for any visible damage or loose connections. We also recommend checking the door latch, the power cord, the heating element, the pump, and the control board. Good luck with your repair.",

      "Hello, I have a 3 yr old dishwasher that isn’t pumping water to any racks. Any idea what is wrong. ThanksHello Lori, thank you for contacting us. We would suggest checking the spray arms for any clogging as with the passage of time they get clogged either by food waste or hard water remains. If this does not resolve your issue, then you may need to replace the circulation pump motor, part number PS12070585. Glad to be of help!",

      "dishwasher will fill and drain but nothing is getting clean. seems to run through the entire cycle, even dispensing the dish tab, but nothing is sprayingHello Todd, thank you for your inquiry. Please inspect the manifold, part number PS11753224, and make sure it is not blocked because it connects the spray arm to the water feed tube. Also, clean the orifices of all the spray arms to ensure that they are not clogged by debris. A defective water pump, part number PS12074533, can also cause this problem as it pumps water through the spray arms during the dishwashing cycle. Customer service is available 7 days a week if you need help placing an order. Glad to be of assistance!"

    "Product_Description": "\nCirculation Pump Specifications\nThis circulation pump is a genuine OEM replacement part designed for use in dishwashers. It is responsible for circulating water throughout the dishwasher during the wash and rinse cycles. The circulation pump draws water from the dishwasher tub, pressurizes it, and then distributes it to the spray arms, which spray the water onto the dishes to remove food particles and debris. The circulation pump may fail due to several reasons such as an electrical fault, a blockage in the pump impeller, motor failure, or physical damage. A faulty pump will result in water leakages, unusually loud noises during use, reduced water circulation, and poor cleaning performance.\n",

      "My dishwasher will fill with water but wont spray. It drains fine. I have noticed before it stopped spraying that it wasn’t cleaning dishes very good. Could the circular pump be to e issue.Hello Kelly, thank you for contacting us. We would recommend you first check your upper and lower spray arms if there is any blockage in the holes. If the spray arms are clear then you need to replace the circulation pump, part number PS16744934, to fix the issue. We hope this information helps!",
      "How do I test the circulation pump to make sure it’s working and doesn’t need replacing? I have it disconnected and have a multimeterHi Nickie, thank you for reaching out. To test the circulation pump for continuity, you need to set the multimeter to the lowest ohm setting or the continuity setting. Remove any power line attached to the pump. Attach the black meter lead to one terminal and the red meter lead to another terminal. If the meter shows a reading between 10 to 100 ohms, the circulation pump is working fine. If the meter is showing less than 10 reading it is faulty. We hope this helps!",
      "Sprays sometimes. Sometimes fills, waits and empties. Next cycle may or may not work. Circulation pump reads about 45 ohms on R-1.Push cancel button, always empties. On restart sometimes works, sometimes not. Thanks.Hi Dennis, thank you for the question. Based on our research, the issue is probably due to the control board, part number PS12070631. We hope this helps!",
      "The dishwasher fills with water and water comes out the spray arms but doesn’t spray.Hi Gordon, thank you for the question. If the dishwasher fills with water and the water gets to the spray arms but still does not spray, then you may need to make sure that the spray arms are not clogged. If that is not causing the issue, then you may need to check the circulation pump, part number PS16744934, as it may not be providing enough water pressure to the spray arms. We hope this solves your problem!",
      "Does this part work with the wash cycleHi James,\nThank you for your question.  Once the washer completes the wash cycle the drain pump would drain the water and go into the spin cycle.  If you need help placing an order for it, customer service is open 7 days a week and anyone will be happy to assist you.  Please feel free to give us a call.  We look forward to hearing from you!",
      "Washer is dispersing the soap but when the cycle is complete soap is in the bottom of washer and the soap pod is undissolved, can hear water going to the drain at the end, but during the cycle sounds like it quit working, is there more than one pump. I pulled the drain pump, impeller turns good, ThanksHello Charles, thank you for your question. The water in your dishwasher needs to be between 120 and 160ºF for the pods to dissolve. If the water doesn't get to this temperature range, then the pods will not dissolve, and your dishwasher will not be able to operate correctly. There are two pumps. One Drain Pump is PS11738151 and the other is PS16744934. Good luck and have a great day.",
      "What is the primary function of the circulation pump? My dishwasher is not cleaning dishes in the top rackHi Hugo, thank you for your question. The function of the circulation pump is to move water through the spray arms to clean the dishes. If your dishwasher top rack dishes are not getting clean, the issue might be due to the circulation pump, part number PS16744934, the pump and motor assembly, part number PS11770231, and the upper spray arm, part number PS11752696. Please check and make sure that the circulation pump and upper spray arm are free of clogs or debris. Replace the part if one is found to be defective. Thank you for your inquiry, good luck with this repair!",
      "Dishwasher fills with water and then nothing happens. No sound after waiting I press cancel and dishwasher drains. Spray arm clean.\nAny advice how to proceed?Hi Chris, thank you for contacting us. Based on the description you have provided, it seems that there is an issue with the circulation pump, part number PS16744934. It moves water through the spray arms to clean the dishes. You may need to replace it to fix the issue. Glad to be of assistance!",
      "W11612326 circulation pump. \nI took it off to clean it, and now the O-Ring is not going back into the seat, so it leaks. Do I have to replace a perfectly good pump just because the o-ring won't go back in?Hello Michael, thank you for reaching out. Based on our research, the circulation pump grommet, part number PS11756098, is sold separately. You need to only replace the grommet to fix the issue. We hope this information helps!",
      "Does this part fit my dishwasher? Do you have the part in stockHello Stephen, Thank you for contacting us. We have looked up the model you have given and have found the Circulation Pump you are need is PartSelect Number PS16744934. We hope this helps!"

      "How do you check the heating element for continuity?Hello Jeff, thank you for your question. To test the element, locate your dishwasher's heating element. Open the dishwasher door and look into the tub. It is the thin, circular tube at the base of your dishwasher. It may or may not be covered. If it is covered, remove the lower dishrack, and then remove the cover.\n\nYour heating element is going to have two metal terminals. One at each end. Each terminal reaches downwards, into the base of the dishwasher. Mentally mark the area where each terminal enters the base of the tub.\n\nNow you need to gain access to the heating element's wiring. You can do this by first removing the lower kickplate panel of the dishwasher. There will be at least two screws (but maybe four) holding the kickplate panel in place. They are located either on the top or the bottom of the panel. If the screws are located on the top, you may need to open the dishwasher door in order to gain access to them. Close the door to remove the panel, though.\n\nNow look into the lower access area that you have just uncovered. Pinpoint the area where the heating element terminals extend through the base of the dishwasher. They will each have a wire connected to it. Label each of the wires so that you will be able to properly reconnect them later. Now you can pull the wires off the terminals.\n\nEach wire is connected to a terminal using a slip-on connector. Grasp the connector and pull on it firmly. DO NOT pull on the wire itself. Pull only from the connector. You may decide you need to use a pair of needle nosed pliers to help you.\n\nUse your multitester (aka multimeter) to test the heating element for continuity. Set the device to the ohms setting x 1. Touch each meter probe to a terminal. You should receive a reading somewhere in between infinity and zero. Because of the variety of makes and models of dishwashers, it is quite difficult to say exactly what the reading should be for each and every possible model. However, if the test you conduct produces a reading of infinite resistance (meter's needle does not move), then that is indicative of a faulty heating element, and you should replace yours. Similarily, if the test you conduct produces a reading of zero resistance (meter's needle moves to the other extreme of the scale), then that is also indicative of a faulty heating element, and you should replace yours.\n\nYou do not have to remove the heating element from the dishwasher in order to test it. Just make sure power is not getting to your dishwasher before you conduct the test. I hope this helps!",

      "Does this heating element include the rubber washers that seal the element to the tub?Hi Greg,\nThank you for your question.  The rubber washers are sold separately.  The part number for the washers is PS11743934.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "Replaced the heating element but it does not seem to heat up on my Whirlpool dishwasher. Connected the leads to same orientation as before. Is there a switch or cut off that would keep power from the heating element?Hi Alex,\nThank you for your question.  If the heating element is not working, you may have to check to see if the issue with the high limit thermostat.  This part acts as as safety mechanism that keeps the dryer from overheating. Once the dryer temperature reaches a certain point, this part will shut down power to the heating element.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",

I had noticed water was all over the floor after about 10 minutes of being turned on, that's when i had noticed that with the door open it did not shut water off as before .. helpHello Cathie, Thank you for the question. We suggest testing the Water Valve. The valve can be tested with a multi meter and should be reading between 500 - 1500 ohms of resistance. You can also test the Float Switch to see if it is closed. We hope this helps.",
      "New machine doesn’t turno water on and not workingHello Marcelo, Thank you for your inquiry. We have researched the model you have provided and we would recommend checking the following parts to fix your issue: the door latch, the single water inlet valve, the dual water inlet valve, and the water level pressure switch. You can test the parts with a multimeter. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, we have videos available to assist you. We hope this helps and if you need help placing an order, customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you!",

      "My front loading Amana door seal was replaced in November 2022, it still leaks.Hello Frank, thank you for contacting us. The issue is most probably related to a damaged wire diaphragm, part number PS11741554. It holds the door boot in place and helps in preventing leaks. If that is not the case, please check the hose clamp, part number PS11740613, and the door boot seal, part number PS11741579, for damage. Please reach out to customer service if you need help placing an order. Glad to be of help!"

What is the next logical replacement part or troubleshooting step?Hi Kira, thank you for reaching out. Based on our understanding of the issue, we would suggest you check if the seal is sitting correctly, if the seal is out of position or has been repositioned, this can cause the dispenser flap to remain stuck. If this does not help, we recommend replacing the soap cup latch kit, part number PS382922, to fix this issue. We hope this solves your problem!",

      "The detergent dispenser doesn't open.  Can you help me please?Hi Frank,\nThank you for your question.  The detergent dispenser is designed to release detergent into the dishwasher tub during the wash cycles and will typically have two compartments, an unsealed compartment for prewash and a sealed compartment for the main wash cycle. Verify that the dispenser is not simply clogged with caked on detergent and give it a good cleaning if necessary. Also check to make sure that the cover for the dispenser will open easily and is not damaged or broken. Check the release mechanism for worn or defective parts and replace if necessary. The rinse aid dispenser is designed to release rinse aid into the tub during the rinse cycle. Verify that the dispenser is full and is not clogged with detergent and verify that the cap is adjusted properly. Your dispenser is operated by a bi-metal release devise.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "How do i check that the detergent dispenser actuator is working. Does it contain a \"spring\"  or does it actuate a spring for disenser.  Riht now the dupenser does not open while dw is operating  and the dispenser door appears to have no spring loading. Open it 1/2 way -stays there.Hi James, thank you for your question. There are two parts that you could check for this issue. The dispenser itself. You should actually be able to test the switch in the dispenser with a multi meter to see if it is working correctly. If that part is fine then it might be your timer. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

      "My unit is not filling, i have checked the input water to the water inlet valve and have sufficient water pressure. I removed the the valve and disassembled and found the inlet filter clogged with calcium deposits. Removed all the calcium deposits blocking the wire mesh filter and disassembled the rest of the valve with no further finding as far as the physical valve goes. I then checked the continuity of the solenoid coil and found its resistance to fluctuate in the meg ohms, i presume that this high resistance is not allowing the coil to properly energize and open the valve.So now my question is, what is the nominal resistance of the coil on a new part?? for reference. thank you in advance for your reply.Hi Darrell,\nThank you for your question.  When you have the multimeter set to the Rx1 setting, the reading for the water inlet valve should be between 100 and 1000 ohms.  If the reading is over 1000 ohms, then you will need to replace the water inlet valve.  We hope this helps!  If you have any questions, please let us know.",

If your dishwasher is filling with water when it is not on then you will need to check the impeller as it may be worn down.

Any help would be great.Hello Jared, thank you for your question. It does sound like the issue is the water valve. If no water is coming into the unit you can test the valve to see if its faulty before ordering. I would recommend ordering the Elbow Hose Fitting part number W10685193 just in case.

I cleaned all water pathways out and i am pretty sure the pump is ok since only about 1-2 gallons are only whats left when the cycle is complete. The float switch is clicking but have not verified yet continuity of the switch when depressed.Hello Lance, thank you for inquiring. For this symptom you will want to replace either the Sump part PS959014, the Drain Pump Assembly part PS2577650, or the Drain Tube Kit part PS2339994. We hope this helps.",
      "Dishwasher is leaking like Niagara falls. I ordered some seals but then felt like the amount of water means it's over filling. Can I test the float switch somehow before I order a new one?Hi Joerg,\n\nThank you for the question, you can test the switch for continuity with a test meter. They can be picked up at a local hardware store if you do not have access to one.\n\nHope this helps!",

      "I recently replaced the door latch but lately I am getting water dripping onto the floor in front of the unit from the top of the door from a lot of condensation along the entire top of the door during the final drying mode.

Since there is no actual water escaping from the door seal would replacing the door seal solve this problem?Hi Frank, Thank you for the question, I suggest checking the gasket to make sure it has no defects or damage keeping the door from sealing all the way unless pressure is applied. You can also check the door strike, the part the latch would connect with. Make sure it isn't lose or is damaged and preventing the latch from fully keeping the door closed.You can also check to make sure the hinges are not warped or bent. The door should be sitting level when it is closed. Hope this helps!",

The smooth side of the gasket will always face out.  There is a video listed with the part on our website that you can reference for more information.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "This is the replacement door gasket for my Maytag dishwasher.  But am concerned that it is one long piece but my door frame is square and has a 3 piece door gasket.Hi Scott,\n\nThank you for your question. Your door gasket is all one piece. Your cabinet gasket is a different part and seems to be the part that you are describing. I have linked that part down below for you. Good luck with your repair.",
      "My dishwasher is leaking from the bottom right. Will this fix the problem? Other # on it is e71195 type 776-0Hi Deborah,\nThank you for your question.  No, this would not be the correct door gasket for your dishwasher.  The part number listed under your model number for the door gasket is PS11747771.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "Replaced door gasket with a new one.  Door is very hard to close now and i can't get it back open.  What causes this?Hi Kay, thank you for your question. The only thing that I could think of is that the part was not properly installed or the door was not properly put back together after the installation. We do have a video that shows how to install this part, you can view that here: https://youtu.be/TX3e5EwRBco. Good luck with your repair.",
      "So I installed new gasket after seeing leaks coming from left and right side bottom of door. After I put gasket in it leaked even worse. From the sides too. I double checked that the gasket was seated properly all the way around. whats going on?hello Bill, Thank you you for the question. I suggest checking to see if the water level is too high. If the water is over the element then it is too high and over filling. If this is the case you can check the Float Switch, PartSelect Number PS11747680. Water that fills your dishwasher lifts this float. When it reaches a certain level, the float triggers the float switch to shut off, thereby shutting off the flow of water into the dishwasher. Hope this helps!",
      "How long is the door seal in inches, part number wp902894.Hello Joe,\nThank you for your question. This door gasket measures to be 66.5 inches long. We hope this helps.",

This Door Gasket PartSelect Number PS11746830 measures to be 66.5 inches long. We hope this helps. No tools are required for this installation, simply remove the existing gasket and press the replacement gasket into the channel around the door.

      "I replaced the door gasket on my Maytag dishwasher with part # WP902894 as recommended for this model. I reran the dishwasher and it had leaking at the bottom.  I also noticed some leaking at the side of the door.Hello Keith, thank you for writing. You many need to inspect under the dishwasher or behind the kickplate Look for leaks or dripping. Inspect water connections, check the floor and hose for dampness. Tighten hose as needed. You may also want to check if there may be a clog. If the line is not installed correctly or clogged, residual water will remain in the bottom of the tub and can cause your dishwasher to leak. If you need help placing an order, customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you.",
      "This is a Maytag model from the 1990's.  The original seal that's around the perimeter of the tub is like a spongy foam which appears to be attached via an adhesive backing.

      "Does thermostat affect pump from draining.Hello Jay, Thank you for your inquiry. Usually not, the thermostats effect the temperature of the water. If your dishwasher is not draining, I would check the drain pump, the drain hose, and the water inlet valve. If there are no leaks or clogs in the drain hose, test the pump and valve with a multimeter to see if they have continuity. Hope this helps!",

It allows the dishrack to easily slide in and out. If the lower rack keeps falling off the track in your dishwasher, makes noises, the door will not close, or the dishes are not getting clean, then it is best to replace it for more security. A flat blade screw driver is the only tool needed for this installation. Open the lower dishwasher rack and remove retaining tabs from both ends of the rack and slide it out. Locate the older roll assembly, remove it and replace the rollers. Remember to put the tabs on each side back before sliding it back in.

      "How do i remove the \"protector cover\"?  I removed the one torx screw but it doesn't seem to lift off easily.        Regards,bobHello Bob, Thank you for your inquiry. It's supposed to just pop off after removing the torx screw. You can try carefully prying it out with a flat blade screwdriver (it may be helpful to slide a plastic card between the cover and the screwdriver as not to damage the cover or housing). If it doesn't come out easily, try sliding a piece of dental floss and pulling it upwards. Hope this helps!",

The vent drives the moist air down a condensation tube, where remaining drops of moisture are released within the door to a moisture proof trough in the lower inner door. When the moisture reaches this part of the door, the moisture has been reduced to a few drops and then drains back into the bottom of the tub. If you are getting a lot of moisture the vent may not be working. Hope this helps!",

      "Do you have video on how to replace the the latchHi Jacqueline ,\n\nThank you for the question.Unfortunately we do not have a video as of yet for this latch but I do have some basic instructions. First unplug the appliance or turn the power off at the breaker. Next open the door and around the edges you will see the screws holding on the door panel, remove just the screws and then close the door. Next remove the front panel. Open the door back up and remove the two screws at the top outside corners holding on the top control panel. Once the panel is removed you will see the latch and the wire harness plugged into the latch. Unplug the harness and pop the old latch off the back of the panel. Snap the new one in place and reattach the harness. Reverse the steps to install the panels back onto the door and you should be set. \nHope this helps!",

      "Water is leaking from under the door; it appears to be an issue at one of the ends of the door seal gasket, but I'm not sure if it is the gasket itself, or how the bottom of door seal piece is setting.  On one side the door seal looks to be sitting onto the gasket as the door is closed, on the other side it pushes the gasket end back, slightly into the dishwasher.  I'm pretty certain one of these is wrong, but I can't tell which one.Hello David, thank you for your question. The door should close on the gasket to create a seal. We hope this helps!",
      "I ordered and replaced the PS 12348515 Gasket.  I was stlil leaking about 6 oz of water from the lower rt corner. I opened and looked at the lower corners or the Inner seal and noticed that the left corner ended up, length wise at the exact end of the door opening. On the right lower side the gasket is actually about 1\" or more too long so it is folded over backward at a 45 degree angle. The seal did not appear to be well seated so I did re-seat the seal. Would it make sense to trim off the excess inner gasket so it does not go past the end of the door opening, below the seal interface with the Door seal PS 11766757Hi Floyd, thank you for your inquiry. According to our research, the gasket is compatible with your model, so it should fit in the place without any hesitation. We have attached a video that could help you with applying the door gasket. If the gasket still folds backwards, you can trim the excess gasket but it is not recommended. We hope this solves your problem!",

      "I got the 4 retainer combs, but they came with no screws to attach them to the lower dishwasher rack. I'm very disappointed. It's a hassle for an amateur like me to figure out what screw would match. And a screw would seem like a cheap enough item to include in the package.Hello Rachel, \nThank you for your question. The tine retainers do not require a screw to attach to the tines, they just simply push on the tines themselves. We hope this helps!",

The door gasket for this unit is PartSelect Number: PS11755809. This goes around the opening to the tub, not the door itself.

Yes, the PartSelect Number: PS10065979 is the correct adjuster kit that you will need to repair the unit. I hope this helps!",
      "Can you send me instruction and pictures to install the upper rack wheels and brackets to the rack. They are not like the ones that are on it now    thanksHi David, \n\nThank you for your question. First you will have to remove your upper dish rack and the old adjust kit. Now, when installing the new kit, count 4 rungs from the back of the basket toward the front. Take your  new metal adjuster and thread the shaft through the fourth rung. You may have to tilt it to get it through. When you straighten the part the wheels portion should be on the outside of the rack and the shaft will  be on the inside of the rack. Take your positioner clips and use them to secure the adjuster to the rack. You will see two front tabs and two back tabs. The back tabs will also need to be tilted into place so that they are on the inside of the rack. The flat part of the positioner clips should be on the outside of the rack. Then you will push the clips down on to the adjuster to clip them into place. Now you will have to install the adjuster body on to the adjuster. Pull your adjuster all the way down. Tilt the adjusted toward the inside of the rack, you will notice that the adjuster body has a channel that will fit the adjuster. Slide those two pieces into place together. You will have 4 notches on your adjuster body that fit perfectly with your rack. Pull on your metal adjuster to lock it into place. Grab your actuator. You want to make sure that the thumb pad of your actuator is facing toward the inside of the rack and is closer to the front of the rack. Pull the adjuster arm up as far as you can, so that the body is a little bit above the top of the rack. The set the actuator inside of the two slots at the top of the body. You may have to tilt the body toward the inside of the rack to fit the actuator into place. Once you have that part in place, push the whole assembly down and press it back up against the side of the rack into place again. Now you will take the adjuster cover and install it on to the body from the outside of the rack. There is a little tab at the top of the cover, you will have to push that into place in the slot at the top of the adjuster body. That just snaps down into place. Then you install your two T15 Torx screws into the cover to hold it into place. This installation is the same for both sides. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "The right hand side of the upper rack isn’t connected to the metal track anymore and therefore can’t hold any weight on the right side. Is there a better part to fix this.Hello Andrew, thank you for your question.

I did the diagnostic mode plenty of times and reset it to clear codes.  Now the only code it is showing is 1.  The diagnosis light blinks once then stays steady on then shuts off giving me no more codes.  The last thing I can think of is the control board needs replacement.

      "Need to know how to replace the spray arm mounting bracket we are ordering part ps11741381. ThanksHello Rogelio, Thank you for your inquiry. Open up the dishwasher and pull the upper rack out. Remove the lower screw that attaches this part to the spray arm using a Philips screwdriver, and lower the spray arm. Press in the locking tabs on both sides with a flat head screw driver. Remove the white screw cover from the top of old mounting bracket with a flat head screwdriver and transfer it to the new bracket. To put the new mounting bracket in place, line it up in the same spot where you took out and hook the top side over and press down on it to lock it in place. Lift up on the other side to push it into place, then once you have it above the rack, pull it back down to lock it in place. Then re-attach the spray arm. Hope this helps!",

You would have to remove the tower WP304170-if you haven't already done so, then unscrew the cap and connector assembly underneath it counter clockwise. Take out the plastic bearing underneath that. Then the lower spray arm should just twist off. Hope this helps!",
      "Dishwasher is leaking during wash and rinse cycles at the bottom of the door?Hi Paula,\nThank you for your question.  If there is leaking coming from the bottom of the door, the issue may be that the seal on the inner door may be worn and you may need to replace it.  There may be some other parts that are causing this issue. Here is a link from our website that you may reference on what parts to check, https://www.partselect.com/AdvancedModelSymptoms.aspx?ModelNum=DU940PWKB0&mfgModelNum=&fkMfgID=3&ModelMasterID=147797&PID=13.

The unit works great and just started leaking.  Really would like to fix and not just junk.  Please give me some ideas.Hello William,\nThank you for your question. If the door seal wasn't the source of the leaking, it is likely that it is coming from one of the common water sources in the dishwasher, and it is only appearing to be leaking from the door. We suggest looking at the water inlet valve under part PS11730996 for your model for any leaks, and the drain and wash impeller parts in the kit for your model under part PS382822. Hope this helps!",

Is there something I'm doing wrong?Hello Carlos, thank you for your question. The Arm should have some play in it but not excessively loose. We have videos for you to access.

    "Product_Description": "\nFaucet Adapter Coupling Specifications\nA faucet adapter coupling allows the user to connect their dishwasher to their kitchen faucet, and this coupling acts as a bridge between the faucet and intake hose for its various compatible dishwashers. This coupling features a plastic end with a mainly metal construction and a threaded section near that plastic end to screw into the faucet, whereas the other end connects to an intake hose that feeds into the dishwasher. This faucet adapter coupling is sold as an individual OEM part without any other hoses or connectors but does come with smaller components inside, such as O-rings and a spout adapter. If you notice water leaking from the connector area of this adapter on your dishwasher, it is likely that the adapter has some form of O-ring deterioration, thread wear, or mineral buildup and needs to be replaced. To replace this adapter, make sure your dishwasher and sink are off, and then simply thread this adapter onto the end of your faucet and connect the non-threaded end into the hose.\n",

      "I live in a mobile home. Will the adapter fit into my faucet?Hello Helena, thank you for your question. The Faucet Adapter Coupling 5304490369 should adapt and fit the faucet in your home. Good luck with your repair!",
      "Frigidaire (Electrolux) portable dishwasher. Leaking from rear left corner underneath (facing the machine). Turned it on its side to check intake valve. Looked OK. Tried it again and leak was worse. Starts leaking immediately when washing starts. Seems near the intake hose area? Any suggestions? thank you.Hi Steven,\nThank you for your question.  If the water inlet valve is working fine and you are still experiencing leaking from the dishwasher in the back, the issue may be that the hoses may not be clamped tight enough or there may be a crack in one.  You should also check the pump to see if it is working correctly as well.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",

    "Product_Description": "\nManifold Specifications\nThis genuine OEM water supply manifold or tube is specially designed for various models of dishwashers. It fits onto the upper rack of the dishwasher. The manifold distributes water from the main water supply line, through the spray arm, to various parts of the dishwasher where it is needed for cleaning dishes. When the dishwasher is turned on, the water inlet valve opens, allowing water to flow into the manifold. If the manifold is damaged, or no longer functioning properly it will be unable to distribute water to the spray arms leading to uneven cleaning, water leakage, difficulties completing cycles and reduced energy efficiency.\n",

      "Hi, i am about to order replacement \"rack adjuster kit\" (ps10064063) as our wheels have broken off (which appears to be a common problem with these units). My question: As we have taken the top rack out we notice that at the connection end of the under-mount  \"manifold\" for the \"sprayer\" there are two water intakes that have these 7/8\" round screens (filters?) that appear to be hinged flap type things. One screen springs back while the other side remains half open. We assume the sprayer is operating ok but wonder if the filter things are critical and if its a necessary (or wise) to to replace the manifold and sprayer (parts ps11753224 and ps11754873) while we replace the rack adjusters?  We love our dishwasher and want to keep it good condition. Thanks!Hello Tom,\n\nThanks for your question.The screens are there to prevent food and soap build up inside the spray arms. If they dishes are still coming clean then there is no immediate issues but over time it will cause the spray arms to become blocked and the dishes will not come out clean. It would be best to replace them before it becomes and issue. \n\nGood luck with this repair!",
      "There are two different manifolds listed for my dishwasher.  What are the differences, besides price?  \nWPW10571946\nWPW10340542Hello Matthew, Thank you for your inquiry. It would depend on the design of the upper rack. PS11753224 is listed for a square rack and PS11756471 is listed for a tiered rack. We hope this helps.",
      "I found the end piece of the manifold at the bottom of the dishwasher.  It is white and two holes and goes into the vertical section at the back of the manifold.  It is stamped  PP-20/TEO.  I can click it back into place but is there a separate replacement part for this?  Or would I need to order the whole manifold assembly?  Is it critical for the operation of the machine?Hello Eric, thank you for the great question. The compatible part for your model is a manifold, part number PS11753224. The new upper dish rack manifold should be installed by aligning it on the rack and snapping it into place. Align the wash arm on the manifold then rotate the locking nut clockwise to secure and confirm that the arm spins freely and your dishwasher should be ready for use. We hope this information is useful!",
      "Hello, so recently found 2 parts at the bottom of my dishwasher. It appears they broke off the back end of the manifold. They are rectangular, one is white hard plastic and is stamped with W10194944 4. The other is black flexible rubber and stamped with W10707572. They both have two holes. Are these parts available on their own or does the entire manifold have to be replaced?Hi Kris, thank you for the great question. The parts you are looking for are not sold separately; these are the parts of the manifold. You will need to replace the manifold, part number PS11753224. We hope this information helps!",
      "The gasket on the spray arm has two covers with the black rubber acting as flaps. If one of the flaps stays open, would that prevent the rotation of the top and bottom spray arms? Everything is working correctly other than the sprayers not spinning and actually getting the dishes clean.Hi Molly, thank you for contacting us. According to our research, the most common reason both the spray arms may not be spinning properly is the build-up of dirt and debris. Opening of flap does not have an effect on both spray arms. We would recommend cleaning the spray arms properly. If this is not the case, you may need to check the circulation pump and motor assembly, part number PS11756615, to solve the problem. The assembly pumps water through the spray arms during the dishwashing cycle. We hope this solves your problem!",
      "How can I tell if I have a square upper rack or a tiered upper rack?\n\nThis is a follow-on question to the manifold question I sent earlier.Hello Matthew, Thank you for your inquiry. According to the manufacturer, with the tiered rack, one side is higher than the other and it also has a different adjustor design. If your adjusters look like part# PS11757358, then you have the tiered rack. If you have the adjusters that look like part# PS11756150, then it is the square rack. We hope this helps.",
      "Upper rack slides out since day one. I watched the tech level the hell out of the dishwasher and when i noticed this happening i checked too. It's level!!! when the upper rack is in the bottom most position it is not a problem. when you pull the rack out it has a positive retaining feel to it. when it is in the upper most position (which we need for the size of our dishes) it slides out. i put my finger to the opening of the manifold and the door swings back and probably gives the rack enough resistance to stay put. when it is in the upper position the door is wide open with no resistance at all. does it seem reasonable that replacing the manifold will fix this?Hello Seth, Thank you for your inquiry. The manifold attaches to the upper rack so if it is not in the correct position or loose, it could cause the rack to slide out. We would advise checking the rack adjusters/wheel assembly as well. Hope this helps!",
      "I am looking for the plastic end valve for the 2nd rack manifold for my dishwasher. it fits onto the end of the manifold and has a black rubber valve with 2 flaps to let water out. can inorder this piece or do I have to order the manifold which will have this piece?\nthanksHello Sarah, Thank you for your inquiry. Researching the model number that you have provided, this would be part of the manifold assembly, PS11753224. Good luck with your repair."

If you find that your dishwasher is making loud noises or the lower rack is getting stuck when you are moving it in or out, it could be that the lower wheel assembly needs to be replaced. The dishrack wheels allow for easy movement of the dishrack in and out of the dishwasher. These rollers tend to wear down at the same speed, so it is recommended to replace both pairs at the same time. Open your dishwasher and remove the bottom rack, locate the locking tab, and rotate until it easily slides out of place. Slide the new wheel over the shaft and locate the locking tab to snap back into place.\n",

      "Replaced door seals and the 2 rubber end tabs, but it still leaks from bottom of door.  What else can I replace?Hi Dave,\nThank you for your question.  If there is still water leaking from the bottom of the door, you may need to replace the inner door panel, part number WD31X10004, as the bottom door gasket is sold with this part.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",

At the to of the tub under the counter where the door locks into there is a latch keeper, or strike pt # WD13X67. We would recommend trying to adjust that so that the door doesn't have to push in so far to lock into place. I hope this helps!",
      "Hi there, i have a black GE dishwasher, and believe the door gasket needs to be replaced as it is leaking out the bottom of the door all through the wash cycle.  Two questions, does this sound like an accurate diagnosis?  It begins leaking about 5 minutes into the wash cycle leading me to believe it's the seal rather than the water level float.  Secondly, the part says \"white\"  and my diswasher is black   does that matter when ordering the part?  Thanks so much!Hi Kathy, thank you for your question. Usually when you are having leaking from the door the first part o check would be your door gasket. You can also take a look at your dishwasher and make sure it is level. You may also want to take a look at your float switch and water inlet valve to double check that both are working. Unfortunately the white gasket is the only one left available for your model. Good luck with your repair.",

      "Having trouble getting part # wd18x213 inlet sump to seal.  What is the trick in replacing. It goes in but will not seal (snap in place).  Please advise. Thank youHi Carmen,\nThank you for your question.  Here is some information that a customer has left on our website on how he installed the part, \"First removed dishwaser from under counter so I could get to rubber connecter. It is located in center under dishwasher. I first needed to unscrew with wrench rubber connection at pump and and then the complete piece unscewed by hand from pump wash arm. I then just had to screw new rubber connector back on to bottom of dishwasher and re-attached at the pump. It was very easy to replace the rubber connector. I also replaced the dishwasher sump housing because it was made of same rubbber material and feared it was deteriorating also. I had to unscrew with wrench at pump as well and it just popped out from inside dishwasher after unscrewing screen inside dishwaser. Popped new piece in and screwed screen back on and reconnected underneath dishwasher back to pump. The rack roller wheel just popped right on. FYI: The wheel is actually 1.75 inches in diameter not 2 inches. I was worried it might be too big if it where 2 inches but it was the same size as the other wheels which was 1.75 inches. The hardest part of this job was getting the dishwasher in and out from under the counter. The good news is that most of these parts are standard and the replacement parts fit perfect.\"  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "Thank you for the answer to my original question.  Now i have more information to give you.  I removed the sump cover and sump strainer cap.  The water is staying in the sump housing.  We checked the hose to the disposal and cleared some build up.  We ran the dishwasher with the hose removed and the water drained but stayed in the sump housing when the cycle completed.  Your reply was to check the drain basket, where is that? With this additional information, can you suggest anything?Hi Karen,\nThank you for getting back to us.  The drainage basket or drain screen is inside the interior bottom below the rotating washer arm.  You will need to pull the lower dishrack forward to locate the drain basket.  You will need to twist the basket one-half turn to the left and lift the part out of the appliance. I hope this helps with the repair.  Have a great day!",
      "My dishwasher started to build up water in the bottom.  I unscrewed the cover and cleaned out the holding tank for water.  Is water supposed to stay in there all the time?  Or is it supposed to drain out when used.Hi Karen,\nThank you for your inquiry.  The water is supposed to completely drain out once a dishwashing cycle is completed.  If there is water pooling at the bottom of your dishwasher it could be that food or debris is blocking the drain drain basket or the drain hose and you need to clean them out.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "Our dishwasher will not hold the water in the tub when it is washing. It runs out of the drain hose as it washes. How do I stop the water from draining out?Hello Tim, thank you for your question. Once the reservoir is filled, a pump sprays water and soap all over the dishes. At the end of the cycle, the pump will discharge water out of the drain. Our suggestion is to replace the Timer PS959249. The purpose of a dishwasher timer is to control the unit's cycles by regulating the length of time that power is directed to each component. We are pleased to have been able to help."

I have leveled  the freezer and can't get door to seal\nPart number for the door gasket was 3206261. \nDo i need to replace the door bearingsHi Mark, thank you for reaching out. We would suggest checking that the door gasket is properly installed. You may need to align the upper portion of the new gasket by inserting the lip of the gasket behind the edge of the door liner. Tight the upper screws to secure this part of the gasket, align the new gasket and tight all the screws. If the issue still persists, you may need to replace the hinge bearings. The lower hinge bearing is part number PS1146288 and the upper hinge bearing is part number PS469754. We hope this will resolve your problem!"

When I apply pressure on the door by pushing it inwards it starts again but within minutes stops.  This disruption continues through the whole dish washing process.  During the drying period there is no problem.  Should i give this part a try?Hi Mary Kay,\n\nThank you for the question. I suggest replacing the Switch Holder, PartSelect Number PS11747662. This part latches the door securely to the switches can start the appliance. If you can push on the door and the switches engage then the switches are in working order and the holder is not keeping the door closed tightly enough.\n\nHope this helps!",

      "First off, i think my dishwasher was interrupted mid-cycle because halfway through it it stopped and a couple lights kept blinking.After turning it off/on, when I try to click a cycle, it won't start.It still gets power (i see lights), I've tried cycling the power (breaker off/on) to no avail.When I click any cycle you just hear a momentary hum (like it's trying to catch on) but then fail to, and it'll just loop that.  Thoughts?  Door switch?Hi Henry, Thank you for the question. This can be an issue with the door switch or the control board. You can test the switch with a Multi Meter, the switch should read closed. If the switch is closed then you have a defective control board.Hope this helps!"

Based on our understanding of the issue, we would suggest replacing the door gasket insert, part number PS258653, to solve the problem.

There should be no vents or slits in the fill hose. It should be held on securely with a clamp. If your hose has breaks in it then it will need to be replaced. That might be why you are having the leaks. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",

ThanksHello and thank you for writing.\nIt certainly sounds like it could be a faulty water inlet valve PS8760080 and/or possibly a malfunctioning float switch (kit) PS557009 you should check the part(s) for signs of damage or test with a multimeter, and replace the part(s) as needed. We hope this helps. Please contact us anytime if you require further assistance. We glad we could help in the past and looking forward to continuing doing so. Thank you.",
      "I only need the brass attachment of the Inlet valve as it is leaking. Is it possible to only order this as opposed to the whole inlet valve. If so, could you please let me know how much it is and how to order it. Thank youHello Vito, Thank you for the question. The Brass fittings for the valve are only sold as part of the Valve assembly. Whirlpool does not sell the Brass Fittings on their own. Thank you for your inquiry, good luck with this repair!",
      "If dishwasher fills for a consistent duration each time i start cycle (56 seconds), but fails to fill up and thus doesn't clean dishes, is the likely cause: Water inlet valve, clogged screen on water inlet valve, or float switch?Hello Ed, thank you for your question. If the unit is not filling, the most likely cause is the water valve. This part can be easily tested with an ohm meter. The other part that it could be is the float switch, which can also be tested for continuity with an ohm meter. I hope this helps!",
      "Dishwasher won't fill with water. We replaced the water inlet valve and it started working again, but a week later will not fill with water?  Could part be defective?Hi Sharon, Thank you for the question. It is possible the valve is defective.If there is power coming to the water valve and you are getting no water, you will need to replace the valve on the unit. You can test to see if it is getting power with a multi-meter. Hope this helps!",
      "Halfway through the filling cycle my dishwasher stops sending water and starts the washing cycle. There is not enough water in the base so the upper shelf is not getting enough water to clean the dishes on the shelf. Why the water flow is shutting off in the middle. I appreciate your response.Hi Ron, thank you for your question. The first part to check for an issue like this would be your water inlet valve. The valve can be tested with a multi meter and should be reading between 500 - 1500 ohms of resistance. If that part is fine then you may want to look into your float switch being the problem. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "The old water valve assembly no. is  W10195049 (301C101T) and the new part received has a number of W108665472 T-3 (131C23). The electrical connection on the existing washer does not fit the new valve. Do you have the right part? The serial no. on the dishwasher is F04601165.Hi Wayne, thank you for reaching out. According to our research, the water inlet valve for your model GU3000XTXQ1 is part number PS8760080. We hope this helps!",
      "Is this part returnableHi Vincent,\nThank you for your question.  We have a 30 day return policy.  Here is a link to our policy, https://www.partselect.com/Thirty-Day-Returns.htm.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

Yes, the High Temperature Adhesive 5308027429 should be enough to cover both the upper and lower felt pieces. The upper felt guide is not that long of a piece and you don't want to overuse the adhesive. Good luck with your repair!",

We ca not confirm if the glue is waterproof, since it is only made to withstand extremely hot temperatures and nothing else. We hope this helps.",

Let the glue dry completely before using the lint filter.  If you have any questions, please let us know.  We are open 7 days a week.  We look forward to hearing from you!",
      "Can this glue be used to reattach a panel on my stove?Hi Pamela, thank you for your question. This high temperature adhesive is used for installing felt and rubber seals on dryers. So it is unlikely that it would be strong enough for you to be able to glue a panel back on your stove. You would likely have to replace whatever part is broken. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

If those are tested/replaced and are not the issue, the drain pump or board may have failed again. I hope this helps.",

The roller assembly is sold individually and they are not sold in a kit.  If you need 2 for each side, you will need to order 4 in total.

      "How to replace dishwasher roller that controls bottom shelf from closingHi Veronica, \n\nThank you for your inquiry. To change this dishrack roller assembly you have questioned on: Pull the upper rack out and use a screwdriver to release the front rack stops from the upper dish rack rails. Slide out the upper rack out and use a small flat head screw driver to push the tab on the roller out so you can release the retaining latch securing the old assembly. Now release the brackets from the tines to fully detach. Install the new upper track roller by positioning it on the tines, then snap the retaining latch in place to secure. Replace the upper dishrack and reposition the front stop clips and snap them into place. Hope this helps!",

If the function is coming on by itself, then the problem may more likely be in your control board, which is a part that I have linked down below for you. It could be this part however you generally have to press and hold a couple of buttons at once to lock the panel and it is more unlikely that both buttons are stuck unless a user actually over used bother buttons at the same time.

      "How do i install bottom door gasket (ps11703834). This fell out of dishwasher and keeps falling out. Please send reference or instructions to install. Thanks.Hi Gary,\nThank you for your question.  There is a video on our website that you can reference on how to install the bottom door gasket .  The dishwasher in the video may not show exactly like the one you have, but it will give you a general idea on how to install the part.  You will find the video under part number PS9495545.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "Why would the door leak at both bottom corners during wash cycle and rinse?Hello Tim,\n\nThanks for your question. This issue is likely to arise from the door seal being damaged. We would advise checking it for signs of wear and tear. It may also be worth testing the water valve with a multimeter to ensure it has continuity, as that could be causing the leaking.\n\nI hope this helps.",
      "Dishwasher,how to remove door to install bottom gasketHello Jim, thank you for your question. We have an installation video on this part that you can find at this link. https://www.partselect.com/PS9495545-Frigidaire-809006501-Bottom-Door-Gasket.htm?SourceCode=4&SearchTerm=FGBD2434PF0A&ModelNum=FGBD2434PF0A.

      "Hello, I am trying to install the gasket but it won't stay in place - it keeps falling out of the door when I close it and can't seem to find the right spot for the notch to fit.  I have watched the video and can follow the steps but the piece won't stay in place.Hi Nathalie,\nThank you for your question.  Here are some installation instructions from our website that you may reference for more information, \"Remove the lower dish tray and set it aside. Remove the two Phillips screws on each side of inner liner, and then close door. You should then be able to slip off the external facing and set it aside. Pull the lower gasket toward the tub until it is fully removed. Reinsert the new gasket into the same tight slot, making sure that the notch inserts into the slot and that the flexible gasket runs the full length of the tub. The gasket should bow out slightly toward the tub. Also, make sure that the side seals do not interfere with the bottom seal fully mating with the floor of the tub. Close the door and check to make sure the lower gasket reveal is the same across the length of the inner liner. Reinstall the dish tray, then reinstall the external facing, using the same four Phillips screws to secure it. Test the sealing by running a short cycle on the dishwasher.\" We hope this helps!  If you have any questions, please let us know.",
      "Why does my dishwasher leak during the washing/rising cycles?  The gasket around the edge is in tack and not frayed.  With the holidays upon us, I'd like to use dishes not paper!  Thank you in advance!Hello Marie, thank you for asking. According to our research, the leaking during the wash cycle is probably due to one of the following gaskets: door bottom seal, part number PS11703834, tub gasket, part number PS8260227, and sump gasket, part number PS420465. If you need help placing an order for it, please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you!",

The model FGIP2468UF2A has the Dishwasher Door Bottom Seal PS11703834 as you have mentioned. It also have the Tub Gasket PS8260227 that is a 73\" grey rubber part that creates a seal around the dishwasher to prevent any water leakage during a cycle. We have a video of how to replace it on our site. We look forward to hearing from you.",

Good luck with your repair!",
      "What is the purpose of the small holes on the bottom of the door gasket? My current gasket seems to have a good seal but water is leaking out of the holes. Seems counterintuitive. What am i missing?Hello Brian, Thank you for the question. The holes are to release air. If it is leaking it might be a build up of condensation.I suggest checking to make sure the gasket is still sealing properly with no gaps. Hope this helps!",
      "It this the correct fit for my dishwasher, I can't find the part anywhere.Hello Daniel, thank you for contacting us. For us to locate the correct parts and repair information we will require the complete model number of the unit. Once you have located the model number, please feel free to resubmit the question and we will be happy to help you. We look forward to hearing from you!",
      "I replace the tub seal and bottom door gasket. I had the door cover off to make sure the bottom gasket was sealing. Problem is when the washer arm comes around, water pushes out of all of the holes in the gasket. \n\nI read where this could mean the washer arm is shooting water straight at the door, but have no way to check that. Have you heard of this?Hello Luke, thank you for your inquiry. First, check for obstructions inside the spray arm. There are small holes that the water pushes out of. Check there is not debris blocking the flow of water. If possible, visually inspect the washer arm while the dishwasher is running to see if it is spraying water evenly or if it is aimed at the door. Also check the water pressure, if water pressure is high it can also cause this issue. If all checks are fine, we would recommend replacing the pump and motor assembly, part number PS3497737. We hope this sorts out your problem!"

      "Dishwasher, fills, heats up but there is no pump or water flow action. Then it drains at end of “cycle”. No noise either after it fills. Is there a computer that could go bad? I’m thinking that’s not the problem as it seems to go through the cycles so the timer must be working. Otherwise I'm assuming it’s the motor. I can pull it and check it.Hello Bob, Thank you for the question. This might be an issue with the Circulation Pump, PartSelect Number PS3497737. This Pump and Motor kit is responsible for circulating the water through the dishwasher during the wash cycle. Hope this helps, good luck with this repair!",

You could do a quick physical check of your wash arms to make sure there is no debris stuck that is causing that noise when the arms are spinning. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",

However the machine lights wont turn on in order to run a load. What could this issue be? Please helpHi Mike,\nThank you for your question.  If the dishwasher will not start, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the pump motor, the door strike, the tub gasket, the spray arm and the latch assembly.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "Motor doesn't run.  How do i clean out filter?Hi Casey,\nThank you for your question.  To clean the filter, you will first have to remove it from the dishwasher.  Once removed, soak the filter in warm soapy water for 10 minutes and replace.  Remove the baskets and pour one cup of vinegar on the bottom of the dishwasher followed by a cup of baking soda.  Let it stand overnight and run an empty cycle the following morning.   When the cycle is complete, scrub away any remaining dirt from the bottom of the dishwasher.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "What should the electrical resistance be across the leads of the motor?Hi Dan,\nThank you for your question.  To test the motor with a multimeter, disconnect the motor's two wire leads from the wiring harness. Set your multimeter to the R x 1 setting. Touch each of the meter's probes to one terminal each. Your motor should show little resistance (a reading of zero, or close to zero).  Now check the ground connection. Place one probe on the bare metal housing of the motor. Place the other probe on each terminal, one at a time. You should not receive any reading on your meter from this test. If your dishwasher's motor fails either of these tests, you will have to replace it.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

You will first disconnect your supply lines from your dishwasher. Unscrew your top mounting brackets from the machine. Pull your dishwasher out. Now you will remove your top brackets. Keep them in case you will need them again. 6 inches down on each side of your dishwasher you will see the little area where your mounting brackets are to be hooked up on. Just insert your brackets. To lock them in place, use a part of plyers to bend the tab a little bit toward the outside. Good luck with your repair.",

Filters are supposed to be self-cleaning, however if you have hard water, or if you are using the wrong detergent they might get a build-up on them. You can clean these filters, but once they are worn out they will need to be replaced. This filter has a diameter of four inches, and it is five inches in length.\n",

Unfortunately this kit does not belong underneath your model information so we could not say that it would work for you. However you would likely have to inspect the parts to see which one for sure you will have to replace. It seems like the gasket would be the most likely part that is the problem, but it is always better to double check. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",

      "Some buttons of my diswasher don't work including the 'start' button. I am not sure if i have to replace the control panel or the control board. Please guide me.Hi Ryan,\n\nThank you for your question. You should first test all of the mirco switches on your door latch. If your door latch has failed, your control board will not get any power and so your control panel will not light up. If you find that your latch micro switches are fine, then inspect your board. If you see any discoloration on any of the terminals then it will definitely be your board that you need to replace. Disconnect the ribbon from the board to the panel for about 30 seconds. Then plug it back in. Make the latch engage into a shut position. Look at your panel and see if it lights up and reacts normally. If it does not, it is more likely that it is your control board that you will have to replace. I hope this helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Hello, my dishwasher has no response from the buttons on the control panel. I checked the door switch and the bi-metal fuse with a multi meter and they have continuity. If I unplug the ribbon cable from the control board going to the control panel and reconnect it only the cancel light will illuminate. If the door switch is then closed the drain pump will try to run until the start or cancel button is pressed. None of the other buttons will light up or start a cycle. Do I need to replace both the control panel and control board? Thanks, TomHi Tom. Thank you for the question. This sounds like an issue with the control board, Part Number: PS11752011. The board is not repairable so it will need to be replaced. Hope this helps!",

According to our research, we would recommend checking the Turbidity Sensor, part number PS11757214. If that does not help, we would suggest checking the Electronic Control Board, part number PS11752011. We hope this helps, good luck with this repair!",

Is that a part that a homeowner can install or do the wires need to be soldered?Hi Pamela,\nThank you for your inquiry.  You should be able to install the electronic control board yourself.

I changed the censor with the 2 leads, no change.Hello William, Thank you for your inquiry. We would recommend checking the following parts to fix your issue: the door switch kit, the bi-metal fuse, door latch, motor and control board. You can test the parts with a multimeter. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, there are YouTube videos available to assist you. Hope this helps!",
      "The console of my dishwasher currently has 4 cycles very dimly lit that remain on continuously. When i press/hold cancel, they do not shut off. I made sure the control lock button on the console was not illuminated. I disconnected washer from power at the circuit breaker two different times for 1 minute each to attempt to get the unit to power cycle and reset. This did not resolve the issue. Washer will not allow me to select any button (will not illuminate to show that the button has been pressed), and those four buttons remain very dimly lit continuously. When closing the washer, the pump engages for about 5 minutes and then all activity stops. The dishwasher is currently non-functional. I am unsure if i need to replace the console, control panel, control board, or the door latch--or a different part. Any suggestions?Hi Kelsey,\nThank you for your question.  You will need to test the part with a multimeter to see which one is causing the issue.  Here is a link to a YouTube video we have that will show you how to use one, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWC44fHn0As.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.\n",

      "Contacted earlier today and my husband took a look at the inlet valves and it looks like we will need to replace one of those, but we also had whistling during the wash cycle. What part could possibly be causing that problem? Thank you, AngelaHi Angela,\nThank you for your question.  If you are hearing a whistling noise during the wash cycle, this could be a part of the normal operation of the washer or there may be some type of issue in the washer.   If your washer is fairly new, you may hear some whistling sounds as the parts are being used for the first time.  This is normal and will disappear after washing a couple loads of clothes.  If it continues, then something else is causing it.  If a piece of metal from a belt buckle or a bra, for example, goes into one of the holes in the tub or if these items scrape against the tub, this may cause a whistling sound.  Also, over time, the grease that allows the spin bearing to operate quietly, gets washed away by the water and detergent that pass through the washing machine. The result is a whistling noise when the wash basin spins.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",

      "Lights on control panel flash. Pushing cancel button does not work. Tried shutting off power to get unit to reset, but same result.Hello Jeff, thank you for your question. The first part I would recommend testing is the door switch. If the switch doesn't activate you won't be able to make any selections on the panel. The door switch is part number PS11745501. Here is a link that will show you how to test the door switch. \n\nhttps://www.partselect.com/Dishwasher+test-door-switch+repair.htm\n\nIf the door switch is ok, the next step would be to test the bi metal fuse. Part number PS2360984. This part can be tested for continuity. If there is no continuity the part should be replaced. Also check the connection between the control panel and the board. If the previous information doesn't help, the issue would be with the control panel or electronic control board. I hope this helps!",

      "Kitchen aid dishwasher will not operate. The \"heavy duty\" and \"normal wash\" blue lights blink but no other lights come on.  Is there a reset setting or code?  Any suggestions ?  ThanksHi Gary, Thank you for the question. Sometimes the \"Heavy Duty\" and \"Normal\" lights will flash to indicate and error has been detected. You can reset the appliance by unpluging the dishwasher and wait two minutes and then return power to the machine. Open and close the dishwasher door firmly and select a new wash cycle, followed by Start. Hope this helps!",
      "Will not come on wash. Blue clean light is blinking. Will come on to drain when you push cancel. Wash lights will come on when pressed but will not come on to wash when start/resume is pressed. Start/resume light flashes 3 times when pressed. Continuity is good on heating element and high limit thermostat. I replaced fuse but did not help. ThanksHello Paul, Thank you for the question. We suggest testing the Door Switch. If defective it will not allow the Wash Cycle to start.  Use your ohmmeter to test your switch for continuity. Begin by setting your ohmmeter to measure resistance at a scale of Rx1. Touch the metal tips of the test leads together and zero your ohmmeter by adjusting the thumbwheel in the front of the meter until the needle reads '0' on the scale. Touch one meter lead to the COM terminal and the other lead to the N.O. terminal. Do not push in on the actuator. Your meter should give a reading of infinity, meaning the circuit is open, and there is no continuity. Without moving the meter's leads, press down on the actuator until you hear a 'click'. With the 'click' of the actuator, the meter should produce a resistance reading of zero ohms. This means the circuit is closed and continuity is present.Keep the meter lead that is touching the COM terminal in place, but move the other meter lead from the N.O. terminal to the N.C. terminal. You should receive a reading of infinity when you push in on the switch's actuator. When the actuator is released, you should receive a resistance reading of zero ohms.\n\nNow, set your ohmmeter to its highest resistance scale and touch one meter lead to the N.O. terminal and the other meter lead to the N.C. terminal. The resistance reading between these two leads should be infinite.\n\nFinally, take a resistance reading from both the N.C. terminal and the N.O. terminal to any metal mounting hardware that is a part of the switch assembly. You should receive a normal reading of infinity. We hope this helps!",

      "Hi, is there a way to test this pump to see if it is bad before buying a new one? I know i should use a multimeter, but this part does not have two prong to touch the leads to. It has a single plastic clip/wire attachment. Pump seems to cycle on and off not fully draining water from the bottom.Hello Ben and thanks for writing.\nHow do I know if my dishwasher drain pump is bad?\nFirst, check the drain hose, sink drain and sump to ensure nothing is blocked. If the path is clear yet your drain pump is continually failing to pump out water, the pump has failed. If you notice that your drain pump has visible signs of damage including cracks or dents, or if it has failed, it needs to be replaced. We hope this helps. Please contact us at any time",
      "Dishes are spotted or not completely cleanHi Theresa, Thank you for the question. The first thing to check is the soap dispenser to make sure it is opening and all of the detergent is coming out. You can also check the spray arms to see if the holes the water sprays through are clear. It is common for them to get clogged over time. You can try to run a empty load and add a cup of vinegar to the water and it will help clean the spray arms. Next you can you start the cycle and after the water fills, open the door to see if the water is at the proper level and the water should be fairly hot so there should be lots of steam. Hope this helps!",
      "When the dishwasher is turned on, there is a continuous sound (could be a motor) for about 2 minutes, then the washer displays an error of e24 and fails to wash. I have cleaned filters, checked drain hose and all is clean. Is this likely a pump problem?  Or are there other possibilities?  ThanksHi Jerry, Thank you for your question. From the sounds of it, the pump can be one of the issues when you are getting the E24 error code. However you may have to take a look at your sensors as well. If those parts are all working, the problem may be in your electronic control board. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Hi! The dishwasher is not draining properly. The pump seems noisier than usual. I can see the pump spinning when I pull the float up. It seems in good condition. The hose is free all the way. The flap valve is good. Can it be the pump even if it spin?Hello Simon , Thank you for the question. Yes, the impeller can still spin on a defective pump. The Drain Motor could be weak or defective and not able to suck the water through to the drain hose. We hope this helps!",
      "There is a brief grinding sound then the drain pump engages, does not drain all the way. I’m assuming it’s the pump, how difficult of a job is it to replace? I’m fairly mechanically inclined.Hello Jon, Thank you for the question. Once the appliance is unplugged and removed from the cabinets you just need to tip the dishwasher back to access the pump. Most customers have been able to do the repair on their own and it is good to heave a second set of hands. We hope this helps!",
      "The black gasket around the pump assembly is broken. The dishwasher is leaking and has lots of suds. Can we get that part?Hello Larry, thank you for your question. That gasket is only available by ordering the drain pump itself. I hope this helps.",
      "Is there a way to check the pump impeller to see if it is blocked or broken? I can't figure out how to access it.Hello James, Thank you for the question. The pump will need to be removed from the appliance to access the impeller. Thank you for your inquiry, good luck with this repair!",
      "Is there a way to test this drain pump once it's out of the dishwasher. I've cleaned the sink drain, installed a new garbage disposal checked the drain hose for blockage, checked and cleaned the flapper valve in the drain hose, and the dishwasher drains intermittently. I've removed the pump and all looks clear. Is there a way to test to see if it runs properly. The impeller shaft turns easily. I hate to buy a new pump if not needed, but can't think of anything else short of a whole new dishwasher and this one isn't all that old; 2 yrs Max.Hi Steve, Thank you for the question. In order to test the pump you will need a Multi Meter to check for continuity. Hope this helps!",
      "Have troubleshot, won’t drain and won’t run. Suspect the pump. Where can I learn how to replace the drain pump? Degree of difficulty?Hi Stephen, thank you for the great question. Based on our understanding, the issue is possibly because of the drain pump, part number PS8727352. Replacing the drain pump is easy and can be done at home. The drain pump is located at the bottom of the dishwasher. Un-thread the screws on each side of the door that hold the outer panel, and remove the panel. Remove the access panel by un-threading the screws. Once you removed the access panel, you will have access to the drain pump. Take the wire harness out of the connector. Press in the locking tab on the top and turn the pump clockwise to remove it. To install the new pump, you may follow the instruction backward. We hope this solves your problem!",
      "Getting the E24 error code on Thermador DWHD651GFP/01 dishwasher.  Did all the basic trouble shooting - checked the filter, checked the drain hose etc.  Turned power off and worked once.  Then back to E24 error.  Disconnected power cable to drain pump and unit worked once, then back to E24 error.  Removed drain pump and tested w/ voltmeter and got a reading of ~.0.92 with tone (not sure what to look for).  Pump doesn't look damaged or worn out.  Put back on and worked once then E24 error.  Removed pump and reinstalled, worked once, then E24 error.  Tried removing/replacing pump again and this time won't work.  Tried new pump and it worked once then E24 error.  Is it a control board?  A sensor?  What next?Hello Don, thank you for your inquiry. According to our research, the error code E24 means that the dishwasher is not draining properly because the drain filter is blocked. If you have checked the filter and it is fine, then the issue is most probably with the drain pump, part number PS8727352. You may need to replace it to fix the issue. Glad to be of assistance!"

He is pretty handy at small engine repair. We are considering ordering the heating element. Thank you!Hello Donna, Thank you for the question. I would suggest testing the element with a multi meter. You can test the element for continuity. Hope this helps!",

Turn the circuit breaker to the dishwasher OFF and wait 10 seconds. Turn the circuit breaker to the dishwasher back ON. Press the POWER button to turn the dishwasher ON and start a new cycle.

But we are finding the dryer still has a hard time spinning the drum, and when it does spin, it makes a high pitched squeaking noise. Would replacing these wheels help?

However for squeaking, the parts you may want to check first are your felt seal and the glides. Those parts actually help your drum spin smoothly and without noise. You may also want to look at your pulley and drum rollers as well. Then I would suggest looking at your belt if all of those parts are fine. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",

      "will a continuity test tell if the element is bad?Hi Gary, thank you for the question. Yes, a continuity test can tell if the element is bad. You may need to use a multimeter to test the element. Select the dial knob at the lowest ohm reading possible. Touch both ends of the probe to eliminate errors. The reading should be close to zero. Now, attach these probes to the two ends of the heating element. If the reading is between 10 and 30 ohms, this means that the heating element has continuity. We hope this helps!",

      "How do you replace the handel?Hi Annie,\nThank you for your inquiry.  This is fairly easy repair. Here is a repair story from one of our customer's who has done the repair, \"Turn off the power supply to the appliance. There is wiring you could mess up if something goes wrong. Open the door. Remove the four (4) torx head stainless steel screws on each side of the interior door panel. (total of 8). Then remove the two (2) torx head stainless steel screws near the top of the door on either side of the latch. Before you pry the interior door panel off, have handy a non-metallic weight, such as a brick or heavy book.. When you pull the interior door panel loose, the weight difference will cause the springs to pull the door up and closed. The brick will hold it open while you replace the cheap plastic handle. Do not try to fully removal the interior door panel as there are electrical wires attached. Just lien the interior door panel up onto the lower dish tray. You will need a 5/16\" hex nut driver to remove the two (2) screws that hold the plastic handle on. Then, just reverse the whole process.\" I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

It is an older unit and have tried to locate the model number from other various part numbers on the door, however it can not be found.  My issue is that there is a small water leak coming out the bottom of the door.  The existing gasket that runs accros the bottom of the door has deteriorated, the main door seal is fine.  The float looks as if it is working well and is set for the correct water level.  Is this gasket a self adhering gasket?  If so i think it might work for me.  Please adviseHi Mark, thank you for your question. Unfortunately it is not. All gaskets on dishwashers are actually sandwiched in between the front and back door panels of the door. There would be no adhesive involved. Unfortunately without a model number we would not be able to find your part. However you may want to speak to your manufacturer to see if they may be able to help. If you can get a part number from them we should be able to look up the part for you.

      "How long is the drain hose.Hi Jacques, Thank you for the question. This drain hose is 6 feet. Good luck with the repair!",
      "We use our dishwasher once a month or so. The dishwasher drain/dicharge hose connects to the garbage disposal. Has worked fine for 20 years. Now, all of a sudden, we have stinking water, with soap, sitting in the bottom of the dishwasher after the dishwasher has not been used for 2-3 weeks. The dishwasher tub was bone dry after the last use. What's happened/changed?HI Mel, thank you for your question. It sounds like your drain hose might simply be clogged or out of place. The water would certainly stink as it sounds like it is drain water from your last load or whatever comes from the sink itself. Check to see if your drain hose is clogged, if it is clogged the water you are getting back into your dishwasher is the drain water from your last load. What might be more likely is that your drain hose is out of place. There should be a curve in your hose line that goes above the bottom of your sink. Generally it is attached up as close to the counter as possible. You need to have a U shape in the hose that goes above the bottom of your sink there so that no water drained from your sink goes into the dishwasher through the drain hose. If you have no clogs and the drain line is properly placed, the only other thing I could think of is the drain pump is damaged and cannot force the dirtied water from the dishwasher down into the drain of your sink. You might have to look into replacing that part. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "What are the inside diameter of the hose ends that hook to the dishwasher drain?Hello Jim, Thank you for the question. The end that attaches to the pump should be approx. 5/8 in. I.D. or 7/8 in. O.D. We hope this helps!",
      "Our dishwater will not drain water from the bottom.  What do i need to checkHi Michael,\nThank you for your inquiry.  Some of the parts that you will need to check are the piston and nut assembly, the drain pump and motor, the check valve flapper, the belt, the timer and the drain hose.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "PART NUMBER 462 THE DRAIN HOSE, where does it attach to on the dishwasher assembly?Hello Brian, thank you for your question.  Shut off the water and power to the unit before beginning this repair. Accessing the drain hose involves unscrewing the dishwasher and pulling it out.

      "When draining, water is coming out of the vent on the sink. The hose that is shown is way too long to replace the hose needed? There is also a horrible smell as wellHello Antonette, thank you for your question. There might be an issue with the drain pump/hose in the unit. If the dirty water is able to come back into the washer, it can leave a bad smell in the unit and the dishes wouldn't be getting as clean as they should be. I would check to see if there is water left at the bottom of the washer after the cycle has been completed. If there is, you should replace the drain pump and sump kit. When you say the water is coming out of the vent on the sink, do you mean the water is coming back up the sink drain, when the unit is draining? If you could provide a little more information and resubmit the question we can do some more research for you! Have a great day, look forward to hearing from you!"

The assembly includes the hose and plastic connectors. The flexible rubber hose transports used water from the washer tub out into a dedicated drainage system such as a laundry sink or standpipe. The drain hose may become clogged, dislodged, or damaged by loose items like coins in the laundry or by hard impacts from outside. If the hose is faulty, you will likely notice standing water in the washer tub after a cycle, mold growth, leaking, or water overflow. It is recommended to replace the drain hose promptly if it is faulty to ensure the proper functioning of your washer.\n",

The dishracks come as part of a kit, with most parts already on them.  The only thing you would need to transfer are the tines and tine pivots.  These are relatively easy pieces to change over, as they just snap in and out of place with the pivots!

      "My dishwasher is leaking  on the very bottom of the pump assembly, just above the bottom metal plate that is riveted on to the whole bottom plastic drain assembly, there is rust on the metal plate possibly indicating previous leaking, the drain assembly seems to be working. This seems like a major repair, am i right and possibly need to look for replacement dishwasher?  Thank you for response stuHello Stu, thank you for contacting us. Replacing the drain pump is a fairly easy job. We have a how to video here that walks you through it, approx. repair time 15-30 mins. Good luck with the repair!",
      "Pushing normal wash, smart dry and start.  Lights come on saying washing.  Unit huts down after 30-40 seconds.  Running reset, unit cycles for about 5 minutes.  Does not show any fault codes.  Water remains in bottom of tub.  Water pump??Hello Scott, thank you for your question. If your dishwasher runs for only a few seconds, you should check the water inlet valve. If the dishwasher cannot fill with water, it will just shut off instead of move onto the next cycle. To test your water inlet valve, set your multimeter to the ohms resistance scale X 1. Place each of the meter's probes to one terminal. Because the reading can vary from brand to brand and from model to model, there is no one reading you should receive. However, if your test produces a reading of infinity, then the solenoid is bad and the water valve should be replaced. Part number PS12578165.  You can test the drain pump in the same way. A good drain pump motor will give 30 to 40ohms of resistance. If it has more or less, then it’s bad. Part number PS11765780. We hope this helps!",
      "The check valve on the drain pump has been stretched out and no longer fits properly. Am i able to purchase just the rubber check valve or do i have to purchase the whole pump assembly? Thanks.Hello Paul, thank you for your question. The check valve for this specific model is only available with the pump assembly, part number 154580301. Good luck with your repair!",
      "It is making a loud squeaking sound periodically.  Sounds like a squeaky belt on a car.  It is not throughout the entire run time.  Just seems to be on and off during 2 or 3 different cycles.  No pattern to the duration of squeak or time in between squeaks.  Which part do i most likely need?  There is no leaking and it does drain fine.Hi Kim,\n\nThank you for your inquiry. It sounds like there might be something stuck somewhere. Perhaps to a physical check of your spray are and see if that is causing the squeaking noise. You could also check your drain pump and see if there is anything lodged inside of it that is causing it to squeak periodically. I hope that helps!",
      "I need to get the little hose that connects drain pump to dishwasher. When looking at the schematic drawing i see a discrepancy. The hose i need is item #54 but the picture shows it as a z shaped hose but my hose is just strait, but when looking at the pump picture, item #60, it shows straight hose attached to it. How can i make sure i'm getting the correct hose? Thanks.Hi Andrey,\nThank you for your inquiry.  Where the hose is coming up under the model number it should be the correct one for your appliance.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

    "Product_Description": "\nRack Roller Wheel Specifications\nThis wheel is a dishwasher rack wheel designed for the upper rack of your appliance. The roller wheel is approximately 1.25 inches in diameters and includes the brushing you need for installation. It simply clips right on to the rack frame. After the wheel are attached to the side of the dishrack and are placed into the slides on either side of the appliance. Dishrack roller wheels allow the upper rack in a dishwasher to glide in and out of the appliance with ease. Due to the fact the roller wheel is made of plastic they tend to wear out after a period of time, also they can break. We do recommend you replace these rack wheels in pairs as they often wear out at the same rate. These wheels are sold individually.\n",

      "Can I replace the friction sleeves myself w/o a service call. How do I do it?Hello Joe, Thank you for the question. Other customers have said it was a easy repair. here is a post from another customer. \"This procedure assumes that the DW water connection and drain are flexible. Remove Phillips head screws (2) mounting top front of DW to underside of counter. Grasp door and gently coax DW outwards approximately 1 foot. WEAR SAFETY GOGGLES. On RHS check lower end of door spring and note in which notch the spring sits. On RHS, grasp white plastic connector (\"hinge bushing\", with spring looped around one end), stretch the spring while carefully lifting other end of connector up, out of slot in door hinge lever. Pry door hinge lever 1/8\" away from DW body while sliding friction sleeve over its end. Work friction sleeve past hinge hook, past wider section, into narrower slot (about 2\" from end of hinge hook). Raise door to closed position. Insert and hold lower (90 degree) end of spring into the same notch that it was originally in (mine was in the 5th from the front). Loop the door end of the spring into one end of the white plastic hinge bushing, then insert the other end of the bushing into the door hinge lever's hook while stretching the spring. It does not require much strength. CAUTION: If the lower end of the spring is not properly inserted and held in the notch, it can pop out and possibly injure you! Repeat for the LHS.

      "When we have the door fully open it comes back up half way (won't stay fully open).  Both door springs look to be in good shape.  Any ideas on how to fix this issue?Hi Mike,\nThank you for your question.  If you are opening the door all the way and it is closing part way on its own, then the door spring tension may not be adjusted correctly.  To adjust the door spring tension first unhook the spring from the rear leg of the dishwasher.  Then with a 5/16\" nut driver or hex socket, remove the screw from the tensioner.  The screw can be put into one of three holes in the front leg of the dishwasher. If the door closes by itself, move the tensioner to a higher number hole and replace screw. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",

      "I recently found a part laying on the floor that I didn't know where it came from.  A week later, I have found that the dishwasher door falls open.  When looking for solutions, I have now discovered that the part I found was a friction sleeve.  It was split open, so I would need to replace.  However, looking at other questions here, The fact that the door falls open (e.g. no tension at all), do I maybe need to replace the springs as well?  If so, is there one on each side?Hi Thaddeus,\nThank you for your question.  If your door is not opening and closing properly, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the door hinges, the door springs, the friction sleeve and the hinge bushings.  Once you have determined the part you need, please feel free to call customer service.  We are open 7 days a week and anyone will be happy to assist you.  We look forward to hearing from you!"

      "Ice tube door does not close completely. The humidity causes ice to build up. I am thinking it is only the (63) recess door spring. The system makes ice and dispenses cubes, crushed, and water fine. The refrigerator is 12 years old. If it makes better sense to replace other parts too, let me know.Hi Paul,\n\nThank you for your question. If the other parts are fine, you would probably only need to replace that spring. Sometimes that part will just wear out over time. I hope this helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "I was replacing the flap on the freezer door side for the ice maker. The spring part #74 pop off and i'm not sure on how its installed. Can you show me or send me a video. ThanksHi Chris, thank you for your question. We have an installation video listed underneath this part. Here is the link: https://youtu.be/xIICeXtGPWs. Good luck with your repair.",
      "I'm planning on replacing the flapper, spring, and crank as the flapper no longer sits flush against the dispenser.  However, the water dispenser will also occasionally not dispense, it sounds like there is air in the line.  Any thoughts on what might cause this?  (i've replaced the filter several times and still having the issue)  thanks!Hi Andy,\nThank you for your question.  If you have air trapped in the water line, you will need to flush the water system to remove it.  Press and hold the water dispenser lever for a few minutes to completely flush the air out. If the water lines are not fitted correctly or if you have just recently replaced the water filter, air may become trapped in the water lines.  When you install a new water filter, it is important to flush the water filter before using it.  Consult your owner's manual for information on the correct procedure for your refrigerator.  If air is not the issue and the dispenser continues to occasionally not dispense water, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check dispenser door solenoid assembly, the water filter head, the electronic control board, the microswitch and the dispenser door assembly and flapper.  We hope this helps!  Good luck with the repair!",

How do I know if I need to replace the spring, the flap, the solenoid, or all of the above?Hello Matt, Thank you for the question. You will need to disassemble the Dispenser to look at the parts to check for ware or damage. If any of the parts are defective, it will show damage or wear. We hope this helps!",
      "Hi, we ordered these two parts for our refrigerator ps3487864 and ps285013. The video shows removal of the front panel. We have a stainless steel refrigerator and the front can't be removed. Would you please send us a video to replace the paddle ice dispenser and the recess door spring on this newer model that we have? Thanks so much for all of your help and speedy answers. DeeHi Dee,\nThank you for your question.  There is a video on our website that you can reference on how to install the actuator.  The refrigerator in the video may not show exactly like the one you have, but it will give you a general idea on how to install the part.  You will find the video under part number PS1526381.

      "Hi, so had water from behind  the front door panel during the wash cycle, I automatically replaced the tub to door gasket ( rubber)  and the bottom door seal ( plastic skirt).. I still have the leak.. I am now beginning to suspect the round rubber vent gasket.. Am I on the right track or is there something that I am not seeing? Can this be rectified ?     thanks, RalphHi Ralph, thank you for reaching out. We would recommend making sure the dishwasher is being loaded properly, the proper detergent amount is being used, and the dishwasher is leveled. If the issue remains, the problem might be with the door latch, part number PS8770043. It might be causing the door to not lock properly during operation. Also, we would suggest checking the leveling leg, part number PS557020. We hope this helps!",

We recommend checking the lower door seal, part number PS11766757, to fix the issue. We hope this information helps!"

You will need to disassemble the door latch assembly to see if there is a broken part there to know for sure. If nothing is visibly broken, I suggest replacing the two door switches, Part Number: PS11745501. Hope this helps!",

If your dishwasher is stopping mid cycle, the door latch actuator and switches are some of the parts that you will need to check.  You will also need to check the heating element, the electronic control board, the drain pump and the circulation pump and motor.  We hope this helps!  Good luck with the repair!",

      "What is the ohm reading for the lower heating elementHello Dean, Thank you for the question. The element should read between 10-20 ohms. Hope this helps!",
      "My heating element has some sections that have a white coating on it.  Some areas it wiped off, but in the back corners, closest to the terminals, it is almost baked on.  Also, on one back corner near the terminal, it appears to have a rough surface, as if it has rust on it.  Any ideas what would cause this, and is it an issue that i need to replace the heating element?Hi Kurt,\n\nThank you for your question. Usually when something like this happens with your bake element it means that something has dripped on the element. Which may be the reason that the part has stopped working. It sounds like you will have to replace your bake element, but you can test it with a multi meter to double check if it is working or not. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",

      "Hi.  Dishwasher was working then stopped with normal cycle flashing.  Tried pressing all other buttons...nothing.  opened door and closed.  no buttons responded, no flashing.  dishwasher wouldn't start or respond.  if i hit circuit breaker, each time, normal cycle button flashes...nothing else and keeps flashing.  \nplease help!  what part would you recommend.  thank you, eileenHello Eileen, thank you for your question. There are a few parts that could be the issue. The Heating Element Assembly is one. If lights are flashing on the control panel, the heating element assembly might have burned out. The heating element assembly heats the water up to operating temperature. After a set amount of time if the temperature isn't reached a light on the control panel might start flashing. The heating element assembly can be checked for continuity with an Ohm meter.\nDrain Pump - If lights are flashing on the control panel, the drain pump might not be working properly. For two-wire drain pump motors check them for continuity using an Ohm meter. If it's defective You'll need to replace it. Drain pumps are not repairable. Touchpad and Control Panel - If the lights are flashing on the display the entire touchpad and control panel assembly might be defective. If the display works but the dishwasher functions are all out of synch, or some of the buttons don't respond properly the entire touchpad and control panel might need to be replaced.I Hope this helps!",
      "The dishwasher goes through the normal washing cycle than stops and all the lights go off. I replaced the 2 limit switches, 1 in the control panel and the other under the tube with no results. In addition, all three wash cycle lights are always on or blinking.Hi Randall,\nThank you for your question.  There are some parts that you will need to check to see which ones are causing the issue.  You will need to check the bi-metal fuse, the door switch, the circulation pump and motor, the high limit thermostat, the door handle, the electronic control board and the heating element.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "The dishes are not getting properly clean. During a cycle, we opened and the water was only Luke warm. I am thinking the heating element could be the culprit, but how can i be sure that will address the problem.Hello Alan, Thank you for the question. I suggest testing the High Limit Thermostat,PartSelect Number PS11743423. You can also test the element, PartSelect Number PS11748194. When at room temperature, should measure about 6 to 15 ohms. Hope this helps!",
      "The normal cycle light keeps flashing. Shut off power for 20 min turned on still flashing. Removed heating element at got 013 ohms on the 2000 ohm scale. Tested the two wire drain pump and got a 1 on the ohm scale( with probes touching I get 000 ohms). Is the heating element and pump okHi Carl,\nThank you for your question.  If the normal cycle light is flashing, try resetting it by unplugging the dishwasher for 30 seconds.  If this does not help, there may be an issue with the door switch.  Try opening and then closing the door firmly and selecting a new wash cycle to see if this resolves the issue.  If not the door switch will need to be replaced.  Try cleaning the control panel to see if this helps.  Sometimes a key may be stuck and wiping the control panel with a cloth may help.  If the light continues to blink, then you will need to replace the electronic control board.  If you have any questions, please let us know.  We are open 7 days a week.  We look forward to hearing from you!",

If the heating element is working fine, we suggest that you check the thermostat, part number PS11743423, and the control board, part number PS11748221, as these could be the culprits of the issue.

      "Dishwasher is leaking. We've replaced the door gasket, now seems to be leaking worse. Seems like it is over filling?Hi Ron, Thank you for the question. The water level should reach just below the heating element. if it is over filling, I suggest replacing or checking the float switch, PartSelect Number: PS11747680.Water that fills your dishwasher lifts this float. When it reaches a certain level, the float triggers the float switch to shut off, thereby shutting off the flow of water into the dishwasher. Hope this helps!",
      "Is this grommet held in place with a sealant ?Hello and thank you for writing.\nNo, you should not need any sealant to hold this part in place. \nWe hope this helps. Please contact us anytime if you require further assistance.",
      "I've replaced both the inner door gasket and door gasket and the machine still leaks. The leaking seems to come towards the end of the cycle. Is there any objective way to determine where the leak is occurring? I'm thinking of adding another inner door gasket and also the soap dish grommet. What do you recommend? Thanks for your help.Hi Wayne,\nThank you for your question.  Before adding another gasket, I would first find out what the problem is.  If the leaking is occurring at the end of the cycle, it is likely the pump, but you may need to take the dishwasher apart to see which part is causing the issue.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

I don't see a transient voltage suppressor in the part list, but there is a capacitor. \n\nIs tripping the circuit more likely caused by a faulty capacitor, the control panel or something else?Hello Neal, thank you for contacting us. A shorted capacitor, part number PS11753080, has the potential to trip the breaker. Also, please check the door latch assembly, part number PS11754317, the pump assembly, part number PS11703504, and the drain pump, part number PS11753379. When any of these parts is shorted, the dishwasher can trip the breaker. Customer service is available seven days a week if you require assistance placing an order. Thanks again for reaching out!",

      "My dishwasher fails on the sanitizing cycle.  I measured the temperature of the water at one point during the wash cycle and it was only 119 degrees f.  So i assumed that the heating element is not working.  I measured the resistance of the heating element and got 15 ohms.  Is this what it is supposed to be?  The incoming water is at 124 degrees f.   If the heating element was broke i would have thought the resistance would be very high.  So i am not sure what is going on.Hello Frank, thank you for writing. When testing the resistance of the dishwasher's Heater Element, you should receive a reading somewhere in between infinity and zero for it to be functioning properly. So your Heater Element tested okay. You will want to consider replacing either the High Limit Thermostat, part number PS11743423, or the Vent Assembly, part number PS11741358 for your model dishwasher from what you are describing. You should receive a reading of 0 when testing the High Limit Thermostat at room temperature with a multimeter. I hope this helps!",

      "Whirlpool dishwasher  bottom piece believe it's access panel fell off, i can't get it to attach to dishwasher had a can propped under it to keep it in place. I believe the part i need is the plastic strip on top and screws (Whirlpool retainer,  black) can you tell me if this is what is missing to attach part to dishwasher? And if so is it only one piece on top or is there one on bottom too? 2nd question if i buy a new access panel black (ap6008143) do i still need the retainer to attach that piece? Or does the new access panel have attachments? Please send response to email : Torresn@co.Monterey.Ca.UsHello Norma, the bottom of your appliance has multiple pieces that keep it together. Starting from the very bottom you have the Toe Panel with Insulation, part number PS11741359, which is held in place by two screws, part number PS11740645, then you have The Extension, part number PS11741327, that sits on top of that. Then on top of that is the door trim, and so on. We not able to locate part number  ap6008143 on your model. If you would like us to take a more thorough look with you please call us at 1-888-260-4310. Hope this helps!"

If the rear cap needs to be replaced you will need to remove both front caps and slide the rack completely off for full access.

An inexpensive part, it can be a good idea to purchase several at a time to have on-hand when needed.\n",

If the noise is happening at the end of the cycles, when water is draining out of the unit you should replace the \t\nDrain Pump Assembly Part Number: WD26X10025. The standing water in the bottom of the dishwasher when the cycle is completely finished is usually cause by the flapper in the drain pump being broken, or stuck open.

    "Product_Description": "\nCONDUIT MID BLASTER Assembly Specifications\nThis middle conduit assembly, also known as the middle spray arm water supply tube, is an authentic OEM replacement part designed for dishwashers. It is a gray, plastic tube that connects the main water supply line to the middle spray arm. The conduit ensures that sufficient water is released for thorough and efficient cleaning while the dishwasher is running. If the conduit assembly is damaged or faulty, there will be little to no water released during the wash cycle and you may also notice water leaking from the dishwasher. It is important to replace this part promptly to ensure the efficient running of your dishwasher.\n",

      "The sprayer keeps falling down- it comes off and falls down. I don’t know if I need both the assembly and the paddleHi Kyle, thank you for your inquiry. First, you will need to check the connection clips on the assembly. If there is an issue with the connection clips, then you will need both the conduit mid-blaster assembly, part number PS11729194, and the middle spray arm, part number PS16542477. We hope this solves your problem!",
      "Bottom spray doesn’t move during wash and powder doesn’t dissolve.  Some dishes clean others not.  Had this problem before quite recently (march) and repairman said diverter valve was blocked with string. No idea how that got in there. Cleaned it out and  all well until now.  Have checked arms move and no holes blocked.  So do I need a new diverter valve and can we install ourselves, don’t want to spend another $255 on a machine that’s only a few years oldHello Maggie, thank you for reaching out. If the spray arms are not moving and the dishes are not being cleaned, we would recommend replacing the diverter assembly, part number PS16217028, to fix the issue. It controls the flow of water to the spray arms. You can easily replace this part by using the following instructions:\n1. Turn off the dishwasher.\n2. Remove the upper and bottom rack assemblies.\n3. Remove the lower spray arm.\n4. Press the tab and twist counterclockwise to release the diverter assembly.\n5. Remove the diverter assembly and replace it with a new one.\nWe hope this information helps!"

It appears one drives the motor and one the dispenser solenoid. Are you sure this is the right replacement and what is the procedure for the extra wire harness.

      "Model No. is incomplete on dishwasher and part differs from manual: Manual says KUDS24SEAL1. The small plastic lever on the dishwashing soap dispenser broke off where it joins the dispenser.  Can this be replaced without replacing the whole dispenser?  If so, is the new lever made of more durable material (we ended up gluing this thing twice before giving up). Also is a new toeplate/kickplate available--years of floor mopping, etc. have not gone well with this.  Otherwise, the appliance still works well.Hi Cecilia,\nThank you for your question.  The lever is not sold separately and is only sold with the detergent dispenser.  The part number listed under your model number for the detergent dispenser is PS11756747.  The part number for the white toe panel is PS11741360 and the part number for the black toe panel is PS11741359.

      "Part select number:  Ps11745506.  I need installation instructions for this air vent gasket.  Do you have them?  I couldn't find anything on your web site.Hi Charles,\n\nThank you for the great question. You will have to start by first turning off the electricity to your appliance. Then you will unscrew all of the screws holding the inner and outer panels of your door together. \n\nYou will need to remove the back panel of your door. Separate the two panels and then rotate the electronic control board retaining latch out of the way. Then use a flat head screw driver to gently pry back the mounting clips so that you can get your electronic control board out of the way. You should not let your electronic control board just hang from the door, so if you can, try to attach the board with a little twist tie to the back panel of the door. That will help reduce strain on the wires. \n\nThen you will lift off the outer door panel and set it aside, perhaps on a towel to avoid scratching. Then, using a flat head screw driver, on the back panel of your door rotate the air vent counter clockwise to remove it. Now you can detached the inner door vent from the inner door panel. You can remove the gasket and then replace it with your new one. Follow these steps in reverse to put your panel back into place.\n\nI hope that helps!",

      "The light went out in my oven and there’s some type of cover over it and I can’t get to it. What do I do?Hi Jamie, you should be able to unscrew the cover on the bulb, which will allow you to remove the bulb and replace it. The cover is there to protect the bulb, but should be easily removed. Best of luck with this repair.",
      "My freezer light just went out and I want to replace my fridge light too, will this light bulb be compatible with both or do I need to order a different one for the other side?Hello Josie, this bulb should be compatible with both the fridge and the freezer. I hope this helps.",
      "How to get the light cover off to replace the light bulb?Hi Mando, Thank you for the question. The cover is held in by tabs. If you push the cover back the front tabs will release and the cover will release and expose the bulb. Hope this helps!",
      "I am trying to replace the light bulb in this refrig. The original bulb is \"blue\" tint. All i can find is white. Like this website, they all say it is original Maytag/Whirlpool part. What do you say?Hello Ike, Thank you for contacting us. I have researched the model you have provided and have found the part you’re looking for is PartSelect Number: PS971228. The original bulb has been discontinued and replaced with this bulb. They may look a bit different but will still work and operate the same. Hope this helps!",
      "I tried to use a bulb that was 40 watt and had the same size and shape i purchased from a big box store. It burned out almost immediately. I noted that the bulb had a 115v rating. The bulb that was originally burnt out had a 130v rating. Is this the problem. What is the rating on your replacement bulb.Hi Tom,\n\nThank you for your question. Unfortunately the manufacturer has not given us that information. You may need to use a bulb that is specifically an appliance light bulb. You would be unable to use just a regular light bulb. You could also purchase this bulb and it would work for your appliance. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "The light in my oven is being finicky and Ive been replacing it often. I believe it is the right one as I checked at the stores when buying it and online. Is there something I should be checking on my oven that could indicate why my bulbs aren’t lasting?Hello Sheldon, if there is not an issue with the voltage, the next thing to check for would be a loose connection at the socket. Also, when installing the new bulb make sure that it is tight to the socket. Please let us know if you have any further questions.",

If you look at the Freezer Liner Parts diagram underneath your model information on our website, the light is part number 9. It looks like it is on the roof of your freezer cabinet and it is covered by part number 10, the housing. Generally there is one or two screws that you remove and then you should be able to pop off that housing from the roof. Good luck with your repair.",
      "How do you remove a broken light bulb?Hi Jose,\n\nThank you for your question. This bulb is in a few different places. It looks like you would just unscrew it from the sockets. There may be a cover in front of the bulb, you would just have to pop that off to get to the bulb. Good luck with your repair.",

      "Had repair man order dispenser for Electrolux dishwasher. He installed it. First wash the new dispenser didn't release the soap (finish).  Try a second time it still didn't work. What do i doHi Linda,\nThank you for your inquiry.  The detergent dispenser is designed to release detergent into the dishwasher tub during the wash cycles and will typically have two compartments, an unsealed compartment for prewash and a sealed compartment for the main wash cycle. Verify that the dispenser is not simply clogged with caked on detergent and give it a good cleaning if necessary. Also check to make sure that the cover for the dispenser will open easily and is not damaged or broken. Check the release mechanism for worn or defective parts and replace if necessary. The rinse aid dispenser is designed to release rinse aid into the tub during the rinse cycle. Verify that the dispenser is full and is not clogged with detergent and verify that the cap is adjusted properly. The dispensers may be operated by either a mechanical devise or by a bi-metal release or wax motor devise.  The rinse aid cap could be the reason why your dishwasher is not releasing rinse aid. The rinse aid dispensing cap is located on the inner door panel of your dishwasher. The rinse aid cap could be loose and may just need to be refitted, but could also be warped or damaged from the heat of the water in the dishwasher. Remove the cap from the door and inspect it for signs of melting or warping and replace if need be. If your dishwasher is not dispensing detergent, the spring and hinge pin on the dispenser door could be the problem. The dispenser door is spring loaded, and is held in the closed position by a catch. Check that the spring and pin are not bent or broken and replace if required. If the catch is not releasing the door, then you should inspect the timer, the bi-metal release or the wax motor.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",

If the dishwasher is not starting, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the door latch, the strike, the door balance link kit, the turbidity sensor, the motor and the electronic control board.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",

Do i need to replace the control panel?Hello Brandon, thank you for your question. I would recommend testing the latch switches before ordering the panel. If the start button is lit up but the unit won't start, the latch switches may not be functioning properly. These switches, when activated, tell the unit that its ok to start the wash cycle. If the switches are not the issue, then the control panel would be the next step. I hope this helps!",

Does this sound correct to you?Hello Ivan, thank you for writing. When testing the Door Latch with a multi meter it should read as zero when functioning properly. If it reads higher than zero then the switch is faulty and should be replaced. For this symptom you will want to consider either the Door Balance Link Kit part PS972325 or the Pump Motor part PS11773089 for your model. We hope this helps.",

      "Can a faulty door latch cause the rinse aid to not dispense? I think the latch is cracked or broken. When opening the door, the seam between the door and the control panel expands and then closes back to normal after the door is open. The opening is about 1/16\". The screws holding the latch in place are tight. Thanks in advance for your thoughts!Hello Tom, Thank you for the question. The latch does not control the dispenser. The dispenser has a small red wax motor on the back that tells the dispenser to open and release the detergent or the rinse aid. If the rinse aid cap is not opening, you may need to have the dispenser replaced. You can also remove and check the rinse aid cap to see if there has been any wear or damage that would prevent it from opening. Hope this helps!",
      "I noticed the wrong cycle had been selected, so i stopped and reset the program. Once it reset all the lights went out and now the control panel is non-responsive to touch and does not light up.  What might the cause and fix be?Hi Scott,\nThank you for your question.  Try cutting power to the dishwasher for 5 minutes and turning it back on.  If this does not help, you may need to test the electronic control board with a multimeter to see if it is working correctly.  If the dishwasher will still not start, some other parts that you will need check are the pump, the sump and motor assembly, the capacitor, the door latch, the turbidity sensor and the touchpad.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

      "Dishwasher will not start - no indication that it is getting power, yet the breaker is engaged and turned on at the breaker box.  Is it possible that the control module is burned out/not working?  If yes, is it worth replacing it?Hi Bob, Thank you for the question. Soudns like the main control board is defective, Part Number: PS2350039 and will need to be replaced. Hope this helps!",
      "Start dishwasher and time shows on panel 90minutes, then within the fill cycle it goes to 40 minutes then it will drop again to a different time. Overall a cycle that once took 90 or 117 minutes now takes about 30 to 40 minutes.  I do not know if the dishes are actually getting clean or not?   Please advise how to repair unit.  I have already changed the pump and digital display on unit within the last 6 months.Hi George,\nThank you for your question.  Based on what you described, I would check the touchpad and the electronic control board to make certain they are working correctly.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "The pad lights up, select normal wash. You hear it running then just shuts off. Then it will show 125 minutes and run for 4 to 5 minutes and shut off and go back to 125. Have to do this sometimes 10-15 times to get it to run the full cycle. What could be the problemHello Chuck, thank you for inquiring. You will want to consider either the Interlock Switch Assembly part PS783632, the Door Handle Actuator part PS2337860, or the Control Module Assembly part PS2350039. We hope this helps.",
      "I need to reset my dishwasher.  I replaced the module control asm and i didn't follow the correct procedure and need to reset it.  How do i do this?Hi Brian,\nThank you for your inquiry.  For information on how to reset your dishwasher please refer to your owner's manual for further instructions.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "After the selecting the wash mode and hitting start, the dishwasher will not make it through the wash cycle to the end, often not even reaching the point where it will start filling with water.  It resets itself to the default (normal wash with heated dry shown and 115 minutes on timer).  Does this point to the control module or could this be some sensor downstream that is causing the reset?  The keypad appears to be functioning as normal.Hi Christian, \n\nThank you for your question. It does sound like it may be your board that is the issue. You could also check your door switch just to double check it is working correctly and not intermittently going in and out and stopping your cycle from continuing. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "The touch pad does not work. The digital display works and the washer runs in normal wash and heated dry. No other functions can be accessed with the touch pad.  Do i need to replace touchpad and control board or just the touch pad?Hi Steve, Thank you for the question. If some buttons and functions work and others do not, I recommend replacing the touch pad. Hope this helps!",
      "Dishwasher will work properly periodically. Cleaned inside and still doing the same thing. Sounds like it will start and then beeps and shuts down.Hello Shawn, Thank you for the question. This sounds like the Control Module, Part Number: PS2350039 is defective and needs to be replaced. Thank you for your inquiry, good luck with this repair!",
      "Seeing very odd behavior with controls all of the sudden.  Touch buttons are unresponsive.  All of the control panel lights come on during the cycle then the washer shuts down.  Odd lights (ones we don't use) flash on and off.  Guessing i need to replace the control panel? Only way to get back to normal for a bit is to cycle power on the unit via circuit breaker.Hi Chris,\nThank you for your question.  The issue may be with the touchpad or the electronic control board.  You will need to check the connection between the parts to see which one is causing the issue.  You can also try cutting the power to the dishwasher to see if this will help, if not,  you have to check the board and the touchpad.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",

Looking at your model information it looks like the part to check would be your drain solenoid. I would suggest testing that part with a multi meter to see if that part is working alright. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",

If the washer is skipping a cycle and it is starting all over again, the issue may be either the interlock switch or the door latch.  You will need to inspect the parts and test them with a multimeter to see which one is causing the issue.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

Does the assembly shaft get worn out, same as the rollers themselves?Hi Tonya, Thank you for the question. It is a good idea to change both the roller and shaft at the same time. When the rollers are wore out it can put wear on the shaft and not replaced it can cause early wear on the new rollers. Hope this helps!",

You should actually take a look at all of your felt and glides to see if they are worn down and need to be replaced. Good luck with your repair.",

    "Product_Description": "\nLID Specifications\nThis OEM-sourced detergent dispenser cover, also known as a rinse aid dispenser lid, seals and protects the detergent compartment in your dishwasher. Typically located on the inner door, it covers the detergent dispenser assembly. When loading the dishwasher, you lift the cover to add rinse aid before running a cycle. If the detergent dispenser cover is broken, you may notice visible cracks, chips, or it may not stay in place properly. If left unreplaced, it can result in detergent leakage during the wash cycle. To remove the cover, first, turn off the power and water supply. Open the dishwasher door and gently insert a flathead screwdriver between the dispenser body and the cover, prying it off. When installing the replacement cover, align it at an angle with the housing and fit one side in before rotating it to snap into place.\n",

      "Does the dispenser aid door (#00166623) include the round gasket or must that be purchased separately?Hello Bern, thank you for getting in touch. The dispenser door, part number PS8697157, does not include sealing. The lid seal, part number PS8697158, is compatible with your model. We hope this is what you were looking for!",
      "Is the rinse aid cover supposed to stay closed all the time (and only open when we refill the rinse aid)? Or, is it supposed to open each cycle as part of the wash? Our cover doesn't latch very firmly.Hello Sam, thank you for reaching out. The dispenser lid opens to release detergent and rinse aid during the dishwashing cycle. We would recommend checking the lid for any damage. If this is not the issue, you may need to replace the dispenser actuator, part number PS8697165. It is the actuator motor for detergent and rinse aid. We hope this solves your problem!",

      "When set on “heavy” and “extra shine”, dishwasher stops at two hours into the cycle and displays “E-22” water flow”.  Problem?Hello Joe, thank you for your inquiry. If your Bosch dishwasher displays the E22 error code, that means the filter is blocked or clogged, and water cannot correctly drain out of the machine like it's supposed to. This error is usually caused by a clogged or calcium buildup in the drain filter. If you need help placing an order, customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you.",

      "How to you remove old tracks and replace with new ones? Does it need a special tool?Hello Thomas, Thank you for the question. Here is a repair story from a previous customer. \"The repair was easy. You will need to make sure any screws securing the dishwasher are removed at the top front of the dishwasher under the counter and above the top of the dishwasher. Then pull the dishwasher out exposing roughly 18\" of each side of the dishwasher then use a socket to remove the screws holding the tracks in place, 4 in total on each side. Then install new tracks and slide dishwasher back into place and secure.\" Hope this helps!",
      "Dishwasher belongs to my son & wife who live 250 miles from me. They have just had premature twins. I am trying to help them out. The left side of top drawer of their dishwasher (\"Whirlpool Quite Partner III\") just broke and is hanging down preventing use of the machine. I'm trying to find a part # in order to order a replacement. Any help would be much appreciated.Hello John, thank you for writing. The best way to approach this would be for you to ask them for the model number from the inside of the dishwasher so that we can confirm the correct parts. However, by keying in the \"Whirlpool Quite Partner III\" on the internet, there was a model come us as GU2300XTVQ0. So, based on that model, the part that connects the upper rack to the rail it slides on is called Upper Rack Roller PartSelect Number PS12347743. We hope this helps."

      "I have a Kenmore Elite dishwasher Model 630140031 (I had to enter the wrong number above) which i understand is made by Bosch. I need a soap dispenser which I see on your site under part number 00645208 and 12008380. As Sears Canada has been gone for a while I’m finding it difficult to find any reference to their model numbers and as such difficult to know which part is correct.

Sometimes food particles can get trapped in the tiny holes in the wash arm and then water can’t flow properly through the wash arm. You can first check the spray arms for any debris in holes.

We hope this helps.",

It is definitly on its last leg, but the last load I did, the dishes were still clean. Could this be the pump/motor?Hi Trisha, thank you for getting in touch. First, you may need to make sure the dishes are placed properly in the racks and nothing is coming in contact with the spray arms. If that is not causing the issue, then you may need to check the motor and pump assembly, part number PS12712308, as it is most likely faulty. We hope this helps!"

    "Product_Description": "\nWater Inlet Valve Specifications\nThis is a water inlet valve which is used in washing machines. The valve controls and monitors the flow of water into the washer. It has a multi-mount bracket and outlet adaptor. The tools needed for this repair are: a 5/16 nut driver, 1/4 nut driver, and a small flat blade screwdriver. If cold water does not flow into washer, or the washing machine will not fill with hot water, replacing the valve can be the solution. To gain access to the water valve, locate the back of the washer and remove the hot and cold hoses, as well as the whole assembly. Next, remove the four wires and loosen up the clamp. After removing the old valve, replace it with the new one and reconnect the wires and hose. Remember to disconnect the washer from the power source before starting this project.\n",

      "How do i access the float switch/inlet valve on this model?Hi John,\n\nThank you for your question. You have to take off the kickplate at the very bottom of your appliance. Looking underneath of the appliance, directly to the right while standing in front of it, you should see your float switch. It should be held in by one screw. Just unscrew that and you should be able to replace your switch without any issue.\n\nI hope this helps!",

      "three lights are flashing, dishwasher will not reset via turning the circuit breaker (5 minute break before turning breaker back on) off.  The door is latching so its not the latch assembly.  Any ideas I could try next before replacing items blindly?  Or is there a specific problem you would suggest?Hello Angelita, Thank you for your question. Your Frigidaire dishwasher lights are likely flashing because the door latch is faulty, even if it is latched. Part number PS12585469. Besides that, a malfunctioning heating element, part number PS3653449 or main control board could also trigger the lights to flash. If you need help placing an order, our customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you!",
      "The water will not come in through the jets.Hello Tim, thank you for your question. The dishwasher uses the pressure of the water to spin the arms around. The water jets on the spray arm are angled, so the water sprays out at an angle, usually about 45 degrees off the vertical. The water inlet valve PS16218688 allows the water to flow in from the house water supply. You should check both the house and the Inlet valve as well as any kinks in an inlet hose. We hope this helps."

      "Recently my dishwasher has soap suds appearing in the tub. I have run several cycles with Affresh to clear the problem with not much success. Today I ran a quick wash cycle with no dishes or soap. No suds until the rinse cycle. Also the wash indicator and rinse indicator are on at the same time near the end of the cycle and the cycle counts down to 1 and then adds an additional 13 minutes. I suspect in an attempt to clear the suds making me suspect the problem lies with the rinse aid dispenser. After 13 minutes the dishwasher declares the dishes are clean…which they are but suds remain in the tub. What do I need to correct this? The length of time displayed for the speed cycle has recently increased prior to starting the dishwasher. Is this a control board problem? Thanks in advance for any help you are able to provide.Hello Sue, thank you for contacting us. According to our research, the issue is probably with the detergent dispenser, part number PS958966.

We would recommend cleaning the spray arms and ensuring that their holes are not clogged. Also, check the ultra-fine filter, part number PS12342852, and replace it if clogged or damaged. The spray arm rotation and spray depends on the water pressure provided by the circulation pump, part number PS11772000. It delivers water to the spray arms to clean your dishes. We look forward to hearing from you if you need assistance with placing an order through our 7-day-a-week customer service. We hope this helps!",

      "water is leaking out of the bottom of door how is this fixedHello Russell, thank you for contacting us. Please ensure that the drainage system is working and water is not accumulating in the dishwasher. The most probable cause of the issue is a bad seal, part number PS11731683. The seal forms a watertight barrier between the door and the dishwasher tub, deterring water from escaping during a wash cycle. When it is damaged the water will leak through the bottom of the door. Customer service is always available to help you place an order if you are having trouble doing so. Good luck with your repair.",
      "We were wanting to know if instead of buying the accumulator and filter do you just sell the filter alone? We do not need the accumulator.Hi Tanya, thank you for reaching out. Unfortunately, the filter and accumulator are only sold together in an assembly, part number PS897295. If you need to change the filter, you will need to replace the whole filter assembly. If you require assistance to place an order, please contact customer service. We hope that helps!",
      "My Kitchen aid dish washer would not drain. I found  part of the check valve, the round part stuck in the drain line. cleared the line, replaced the check valve with a new one  per the part number , however the round tap part seems to be a bit smaller in diameter. then the factory one. The drain pump checked out to operate perfectly.\nReassembled, turn it on and the washer worked great except there were a small amount of water left in the bottom of the tank when finished , just barely covering the filter mesh. I pressed  the drain button and it completely drained.\nFootnote:\nWhen going through wash cycle the draining through the garbage disposal was not a hard rush of water.\nThank you,Hi Calvin,\nThank you for your question.  The check valve was recently updated by the manufacturer and may differ in appearance from the original.  It is normal for a cup of water to remain in the dishwasher.  This water is there to keep the seals from drying up and will drain when you start a new cycle.  If it is more than a cup, check the drain hoses for any clogs.  Where your dishwasher is connected to a garbage disposal, make sure that the knockout plug has been removed. If you have any questions, please let us know.  We are open 7 days a week.  We look forward to hearing from you!"

Here is a Repair Story from a previous customer that may help. Good luck with the repair! \" Turned off the power at the breaker; took the screws out of the door panel; the control panel was already loose; I took the lock mechanism off the panel, and then removed the electric bundle panel from the control panel; the only thing left was the circuit board, which I removed, and the wires to it were in a clip all together; I clipped the wires to the new circuit board, replaced it in the panel slot, then clipped in the wire bundle; the lock mechanism fit right where it was supposed to, then I replaced all the screws in the door panel , starting at the top where the control panel was; I turned the power back on, then turned on the dishwasher- it worked just like new. This was a fairly easy fix for about $150; that would have been the service charge and time alone for a repairman, not including the marked up price of the parts. PartSelect was a lifesaver.\"",

Thanks billHi William,\nThank you for your question.  If the dishwasher is not draining, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which ones are causing the issue.  You will need to check the drain solenoid and bracket assembly, the inlet sump, the pump filter coupler, the lower spray arm base, the armature link, the impeller, the corner tub baffles and the fine filter.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

      "Our KitchenAid dishwasher is still going strong after 28 years! It recently started making a noise which I tracked down to the circulation pump. However, the pumps shown here don't have a pressure switch to which the drain hose connects. Are they now built in to this pump?Hello Robert, thank you for contacting us. According to our research, the pressure switch is not present inside the pump assembly. If an item becomes stuck in the pump assembly or the pump impeller is clogged or broken, it can cause a loud buzzing or grinding sound. If the pump impeller, part number PS12069388, is damaged, it should be replaced. If it does not help, you will need to replace the circulation pump and motor, part number PS11757388. We hope this is what you were looking for!",

      "We ordered this part for our Whirlpool dishwasher, but there are no instructions in the package.  Can  you please email those to me?Hi Ira, Thank you for the question. Here is a repair story left on the site from a previous customer on how they installed the spring. \" Open door part way and flex the plastic hinge 'pins' on the kick plate out of the door itself. Once these are out you can close the door and lay the kick plate down towards you. This will expose a spring that is attached to pins on either side of the kick plate and held in place by a rubber cap. Remove the cap, pull the loop of the spring off the pin, and repeat for the other side. At this point you can remove the kick plate and set aside out of the way. There is a second plate behind the kick plate held in place by four screws. Remove the screws with a Phillips head screw driver or a 1/4 inch wrench or socket, then remove the plate and set aside. Now you have exposed the frame rails that somewhat hide the springs, one on each side.\" Hope this helps!"

      "The seal on the bottom of the door is deteriorating, the dishwasher is three years old, is this normal? Or are we doing something wrong? also should I change the door seal at the same time?Hello Doug, Thank you for your inquiry. Seals can get squeezed over time to the point where they no longer seal properly or debris can get caught in the seal and deteriorate it further.  You can check the door gasket to see if there is any visible damage and if so, replace it. We hope this helps."

If the door will not stay closed, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  Here is a link from our website that you may reference on what parts to check,  https://www.partselect.com/AdvancedModelSymptoms.aspx?ModelNum=KUDP02FRBT1&mfgModelNum=&fkMfgID=3&ModelMasterID=92714&PID=91.

The door stays closed with the old gasket, so it seems the new gasket is too big.  The new gasket is a different shape than the old gasket.Hi Beverlee, thank you for contacting us. You are going to have to look at the parts to see why your door is not closing correctly. If you installed this part correctly and all of your parts are fine then you should have no issues closing the door. I would suggest you look at the parts and see if they are all undamaged and you may also want to make sure you installed the part correctly. We have a video above that you can look at to reference.

If you do not have an item like this what can I do to fix problem.  Thank you. KarenHello Karen, Thank you for the question. The Seal is not to fill a gap between the appliance and the Kitchen Cabinet sorry. The seal forms a watertight barrier between the door and the dishwasher tub. The Appliance should be mounted to prevent it from moving. Checking the model we do not list the optional Trim or Filler kit to fill in any gaps. For more specialized assistance or to speak with someone about this, I would suggest calling the manufacturer of the appliance directly. We hope this helps.",

DanHello Dan, Thank you for contacting us. We have researched the model you have provided and have found the part you are looking for is PartSelect Number PS2326584. We looked up the part and it is listed as No Longer Available/Discontinued sorry. There are no part substitutions listed.

      "I saw a video on replacing heating element brass nut but thinking about replacing the grommet at same time. Is there a video on that replacement available for that jobHi Leighton,\nThank you for your inquiry.  I am not showing a video listed with the grommet on our website, but a customer has left a comment as to how they have installed the part.  \"Removed lower trim covers (2 Phillips screws) disconnected power supply at breaker box. Removed wire from heating element, removed (broken) brass nut, unclipped heating element and removed. Removed flat washers and replaced with new grommets. Kind of tricky getting them in there. Also had to lube them with silicone to get the element back through. Installed new brass nuts and installed wire connectors. Reset breaker and started dishwasher to verify repair. No leaks, working just fine, reinstalled lower trim covers\"  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "One question if this brass nut keeps breaking why keep using it.  We paid 129.00 dollars to fix it but our repair man only had one nut both were broken.  We replaced one and dishwasher is working fine no leaks  how come  we are replacing second nut ourselvesHello Karen, Thank you for the question. We believe this is a concern you need to address with the manufacturer. We are a company that simply sells replacement parts. We do not manufacture any units, provide technical support, authorize substitutes, or fulfill warranty claims. Please make contact with your manufacturer directly. Hope this helps!"

The nozzle assembly can be found at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It is responsible for spraying water onto the dishes and utensils inside the dishwasher using a series of nozzles that release pressure water. Over time, the sprayer head may become clogged due to a build of debris and soap residue, or it may also be damaged by a falling item. If the sprayer head is faulty, you will likely notice that your dishes are not cleaned properly after a cycle, and they have spots of leftover soap residue. It is important to replace the sprayer head to keep your dishwasher running efficiently.\n",

This part senses heat from the igniter to monitor if it is hot enough to ignite gas to light the burner. Once the igniter is hot enough it will open the valve and allow gas to flow. This is a safety mechanism to prevent dangerous levels of gas from building up. To repair, the main top of the dryer should be lifted, as well as the front panel to access the component. This flame sensor assembly is made of both plastic and metal.\n",

      "How do I know that the heat sensor is bad? My igniter lights but gas valve does not open.Hi Bill,\n\nThank you for your inquiry. You can test your sensor with a multi-meter to see if it is still working. First you will have to disconnect the power to your appliance and then remove the sensor. Second you will set your multi-meter to the lowest setting and then calibrate it to show zero. Take each probe of your meter and touch one to each of the prongs on your sensor. If the meter continues to show zero or infinite ohms, your sensor is bad and needs to be replaced. Good luck with your repair!",
      "In reference to response to my prior question \"you will need to check the radiant Flame sensor, the thermal fuse, the thermostat, the igniter, the heater assembly and the high limit thermostat\", is there documents on exactly what and how to check each of the parts referenced? Thank you again...Hi Jeff, thank you for your question. Unfortunately no. However you would test all of those parts with a multi meter. Your radiant flame sensor, thermostats, and thermal fuses should be testing 0 ohms to be working. Your igniter should read between 50 - 400 ohms. Your heating element should read between 0 - 50 ohms. You will need to remove all of those parts before testing to have accurate results. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Regarding the advice you offer on testing electrical components with a multi-meter.Testing coils is a good example as digital meters send pulses and analog meters send constant current. Coils react differently to these. Do the numbers you use apply to both digital and analog meters? I figure the ignitor and sensors do not have this (possible) issue. TyiaHi John,\nThank you for your question.  To test a radiant flame sensor, Set a multimeter to the lowest ohms of resistance setting. The sign for ohms looks like a horseshoe, and depending on your model, this setting could be RX1, 200, 2K, or X10. Touch the probes together on an analog meter and rotate the dial on the side of the meter until the needle rest at zero on the far right of the display.  Pull the wire connectors off the flame sensor terminals. Touch one multimeter probe to one of the flame sensor terminals and touch the remaining terminal with the remaining probe. If the needle sweeps to the right and rest at zero on the analog meter, or it the digital meter displays zeros, the flame sensor is good. If your meter displays any other reading, the sensor is bad and must be replaced. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "The igniter lights and the gas lights and it burns for a few seconds and then kicks out.  It then relights about 30-40secs later and then lights for few seconds and then out again.  I have already replaced the highlimit thermostat and the two coils, but it is still performing the same way.  What else could it be?Hi Dean,\n\nThan you for your question. I would suggest checking this part, your igniter, your thermal fuse, and your gas valve.  I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Igniter doesn't come onHi George, Thank you for your question. I would suggest doing a couple tests on some of the main parts that usually go out in a situation like this. You can use a multi meter. I would say first test your M series coils, then your thermostats, and then your igniter, and radiant flame sensor. Those are the most common parts to go out. All of them should read 0 ohms when testing them. The igniter however should test anywhere between 50 and 400 ohms of resistance. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "My dryer stopped heating. I cleaned out the lint from around the drum and it heated long enough to dry a small load. The next day it would not heat. I removed the flexible duct, and it heated for about 10 minutes. Do i need a new sensor?Hi Tracey,\n\nThank you for your inquiry. It could be your sensor, I would suggest also taking a look at your fuse and your thermostats as well. If your fuse is out then your machine will not heat. If your thermostats are not working right they could be reading the wrong temperature and shutting down the machine because it thinks that it is getting too hot. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Dry does not light, but glow plug work, is it the radiant Flame sensorHi Wayne. Most likely it is the igniter. Thank you for your question and good luck with your repair.",
      "Keeps giving e1 codeHi Michael,\n\nThank you for the question. The E1 error code indicates that there is an open Thermostat which is used as a temperature sensor. Since you can not fix those, you will have to replace it.The part number needed is PS11746740.\n\nHope this helps!",
      "We had a company replace the heat sensor and the element , still did not work, exhaust internal in the dryer has been thoroughly cleaned out as well as the dryer vent duct to outside, another sensor put on and still does not heat?? what other part could it need??Hello Larry, Thank you for your inquiry. We would recommend checking the following parts to fix your issue: thermistor, thermal fuse, high limit thermostat (part# WP35001092 for an electric dryer, safety thermostat, and the electronic control board. You can test the parts with a multimeter. Hope this helps!",
      "Where are the fuses?Hi Lori,\n\nThank you for your question. One of your fuses is located on your heat box on the back of your appliance, the other fuse is located on your blower wheel housing. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

The error code e25 indicates there is a blockage in the dishwasher system. It could be a drain pump problem or the drain pipe blockage. I suggest cleaning out the drain pump or having it replaced, PartSelect Number: PS8727352. Hope this helps!"

Yes this part covers the holes along the front tub frame. They are sold individually. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Thank you for your previous reply. May i ask a follow up question? The dish washer door becomes a bit ajar in the middle of the wash cycle and the dish washer shuts off at that moment. When i then push both sides on the top part of the door, the wash restarts and finishes and all is well. Might this description help you to determine which of the parts that you previously mentioned might be the shut off problem part and should be checked/replaced first? Thank youHello Mike, thank you for your question. If the unit is shutting off sporadically and pushing on the top parts of the door activates the washer again, the issue is with the door latch and switches. You would want to replace both switches, part number Door Switch PartSelect Number: PS11745501. Good luck with your repair!",
      "The door is opening while the dishwasher is running and this is causing a shutoff of the dishwasher. I noticed that  one of the tub cap points (part ps11703426) is cracked and somewhat bent. The other tub cap seems fine. Can this be the cause for the door to open? Thank you.Hi Mike,\nThank you for your question. The tub cap is just one part that you will have to check.  There are some parts that you will need to check to see which ones are causing the issue.  You will need to check the door balance link kit, the strike plate, the door latch, the door balance spring, the detergent and rinse aid dispenser and the door hinges.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "There is an inlet that lets water into the dishwasher on the left side I believe ther was some kind of cover that may have been broke of because it really shoots water out of there and causes it to shoot out the door.Hi Gary, thank you for reaching out.

If you need help placing an order, customer service is available 7 days a week. Glad to be of help!",

      "Looking for the dishrack stop for my upper dishrack on my dishwasher. I think my unit has two of these- one on the left and one on the right.

      "Re:  Wpw10195622 “rack stop clip”.  Your answer to multiple questions (paul, et al) is wrong. This part goes in the back end of the “slide rail”/“drawer track” (wpw10195623) to keep the track from coming off, and to remove or replace when removing and replacing the rail.  It is more robust than the front rack stop, which is part of the “drawer track” assembly and apparently not available separately.  This front stop consists of a robust plastic base, that is molded (melted) permanently onto the front end of the metal rail (“track”), and a flimsier plastic from stop that snaps on and swivels 90 degrees to allow you to remove the drawer for cleaning.  This front swiveling drawer stop is the one that breaks so that the rack comes off the rail if you pull it out too far.  The only way to get this part is to replace the “drawer track” (above), or canabolize another machine, since it is part of that assembly.Hi Tim, \n\nThank you for your information, that is very helpful. One thing to note is that not all models are actually formatted the same. Though many models use the same sort of parts, they are not all used the same way. Some models use this clip as the front piece, in your particular case it is used as the back piece and the front piece only comes with the rack track. If you ever have any questions about parts just let us know, we can generally determine what part goes where by using your diagrams. I hope that helps. Have a great day.",

We had a similar question asked by another customer, here is the answer: start by pulling out the rack. Then, using a small flat blade screwdriver, reach in behind the rack stops and press the clips in. From there the stops can be pulled off the track. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "The front clip on the top rail has broken and i'm wondering if this can be purchased separately for this model or if i need to get the entire rail.  Note that this clip on this model is different than the back clip. It snaps open so that you can remove the top drawer completely.Hello Nicky, thank you for your question. The front clip on the upper rail is only available by ordering the whole rail. You will have to order PartSelect Number PS11750072. Good luck with your repair!",

      "How does one install the pully springs?Hi Frank,\n\nThank you for your question. We do not have any information for your model specifically, but here is a video on how to install dishwasher door springs: https://youtu.be/OhRlIhy_vhM . Good luck with your repair.",
      "When opening the door it drops quickly, just wondering if this could be the springs or something else in the doorHello Ralph, thank you for your question. Your issue could be caused by the springs, but its more likely the door cable(s) have broken. Here are the part numbers for the cables PartSelect Number: PS1524995, and the links that attach them to the unit, PartSelect Number: PS1524997 and PartSelect Number: PS1524998. I hope this helps!",
      "Is there one or two door springs for this door?Hi Cecil,\n\nThank you for your question. You have 2 door springs on your model. One on each side. Good luck with your repair.",
      "On this model to replace the friction cable and the spring, how many do i need ? On just one side or both sides?Thank you!!Hello Julie, thank you for inquiring. There is one Door Spring part PS1524996 and one Friction Door Cable part PS1524995 on each side.",
      "My kid fell on the door while it was open and now the dishwasher opens too far and causes the rack to slide down. Do you have a video for that repair and the needed parts? Thanks in advance, joelHello Joel, Thank you for contacting us. I am very sorry to hear that and hope everyone is ok! I suggest checking the following parts: PS1524996 Door Spring, PS1524995 Friction Door Cable, counter balance arms PS12365372 PS12365372, and just checking the screws that mount the top of the dishwasher into the counter. Hope this helps!",
      "When i open the door it quickly slams open... would it be the spring or something else? \nthank you for your help.Hi Julie, thank you for your question. You should take a look at your spring to make sure it does not need replacing but the part to really check would be your friction cable. That part along with the spring helps your door not to fall quickly to the floor. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Does this door need one or two springs? Do i need to buy a fiction door too?Hi Adriana,\n\nThank you for your question. Yes you would need two springs for your door. If your friction pulleys and cables are broken, then yes you would probably have to replace them as well. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Opening & closing the dishwasher door is very noisy!!Hello Jeanette, Thank you for the question. This is normally caused by worn springs, PartSelect Number PS1524996. Hope this helps!",
      "Hi. Do I need to order the whole mechanism if I have the spring to the DW door?Hello Rebecca, thank you for your question. We have researched the model you have provided, and we would suggest the Friction Door Cable, part number PS1524995, and the Counterbalance Arm, part number PS12365372. We hope this helps!",
      "The door drops when it’s opened. What parts do you think I should purchase to repair.Hi Louise,\nThank you for your question.  If your dishwasher door drops when you open it, you may need to purchase the friction door cable, part number PS1524995, the door spring, part number PS1524996, or the door hinge kit, part number PS12365372.  If you would like to place an order for these parts, you may order them either online or by calling our customer service line and anyone will be happy to assist you.  We hope this helps!  If you have any questions, please let us know."

I suggest checking the Door Springs, PartSelect Number PS815938. The door spring applies tension to the dishwasher door so that the door does not drop too quickly or too far when it is opening.

      "How does the drain valve shaft seal go in...there's a flat side and a side with a channel...which side faces in and which side faces outHi Ben,\n\nThank you for your inquiry. You will have to first dip your new seal in water. Then install it on to the shaft with the lip side facing downward. Make sure that the seal is positioned below the mounting clip groove when you install it. I hope this helps. Good luck with your repair.",

      "Looking for a tutorial on how to drain standing water.Hello Donna, Thank you for the question. After checking for any blockage in the drain pump and hose and making sure the filter is clean, mix together about one cup each of baking soda and vinegar and pour the mixture into the standing water at the bottom of the dishwasher. Leave for about 20 minutes. If the water is draining or starting to drain at that time, rinse with hot water and then run the dishwasher's rinse cycle.

      "Will this seal work with the impeller motor shaft?\n(since the impeller and seal assembly is no longer available)\nThanks\nDougHello Doug, Thank you for your inquiry. We show that this part is designed to form a watertight seal around the flapper valve shaft and is only 1/3 of an inch in diameter so would not fit the impeller motor shaft. We do show a replacement part number for the impeller and seal kit, PS10055464. Good luck with your repair and if you need assistance with placing an order, please do not hesitate to call our customer service, open 7 days a week to help you. We look forward to hearing from you."

Its primary function is to catch and trap small particles of food, debris, and other contaminants that may be present in the water circulating inside the dishwasher during the wash and rinse cycles. This filter helps prevent these particles from clogging the pump or recirculating back onto the dishes. Signs of a faulty micro filter include poor cleaning performance, slow drainage, stagnant water at the bottom of the tub, and loud and unusual noises when the dishwasher is running. It is recommended to clean the filter once a month for optimal performance.\n",

      "I have a Bosch dishwasher, that i am receiving an error code of E22.   I clean the filter and solves the problem.   But i am getting the error more frequently.  How often should this filter need to be replaced?  It is years old   original.   It is the filter micro, part #00645038.  Also, for some unknown reason, we have a lot of scaling     never had it before    think it came from a new (cheap) dish washing soap.  And yes we are on a well, water is not that hard     never had a problem before now....  appreciate you help.Hi James, \n\nThank you for your question. Honestly changing the filter in a dishwasher really depends on how much debris is going through your dishwasher as it is cleaning. It is generally suggested that you just change it as needed. This particular filter has a very fine filter mesh. If it gets too clogged up to clean off then you will likely have to replace it. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Get error code e24Hello Richard, Thank you for your inquiry. The error code means that the dishwasher is not draining properly. Check the drain filter and drain hose for any clogs. Test the drain pump with a multimeter to see if is functioning correctly. Hope this helps!",
      "We just bought a home that came with an installed Bosch dishwasher. I notice that the dishwasher sometimes does not drain completely. When I removed the fine filter I noticed that the unit is missing the large object trap, & the micro filter. Do you sell these parts?Hello Bruce, Thank you for contacting us. I have researched the model you have provided and have found the part you are looking for is PartSelect Number: PS8730270 for the Mirco Filter but I am not showing a Large Object trap on this model sorry. Thank you for your inquiry, good luck with this repair!",
      "Our dishwasher has some issues.  At one point I was able to systematically push the start button after checking the filter and lifting of the water level module.  It would start and go through the cycle.  Now all it does is go through the pump at the beginning of the cycle and then does nothing. I just figure the control module, because of the push buttons, no longer is able to send the correct signal to the water pump to start.  Any help would be much appreciatedHello Greg, Thank you for the question. This does sounds like it is a defective Control Unit, PartSelect Number PS8732999 that would need to be replaced. Hope this helps!",
      "Is there a cover that goes on micro filterHi Larry, thank you for reaching out. We have found that there is no cover that goes on the micro filter. We hope this information helps!",
      "Shows e25. What could be the problem?Hi Doak, thank you for your question. The E25 error code means that you have a clog in your pump system. I would suggest you check and perhaps clean out your filters. If those parts are all cleaned out and you are still having the issue you may actually have to replace the pump itself. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Does this micro filter fit the above Bosch model?  I would also need a new filter sleeve. Do you carry those for this model? Thanks.Hi Pia, PS8730270 is compatible with your model SHE3AR55UC/08. I am unsure what you mean by sleeve, the screen is PS8714287 and the fine filter is linked below as well. Thank you for your question and good luck with your repair!",
      "how do i remove the pump coverHi John,\nThank you for your question.  The covers for the pumps listed for your model are part of the pumps and do not come off.  If you require more information on the pumps for your dishwasher, you will need to contact Bosch.  We hope this helps! If you have any questions, please let us know."

    "Product_Description": "\nDrain Pump -120V 60Hz Specifications\nThis is a drain pump assembly for various compatible models of dishwashers, that is responsible for draining the water from the dishwasher after every cycle. This drain pump assembly is made of plastic and fits within the sump assembly, which controls the flow of water into the drain. This drain pump assembly is a genuine OEM part and is made of a high-quality plastic but is sold as an individual component without any other parts, like its drain pump check ball which works within the pump to prevent water from backwashing into the pump, as well as the drain pump cover. If you notice your dishwasher is not draining or has a lot of water buildup at the bottom of the sump assembly, this filter may be damaged, clogged or broken, and in need of a replacement. To replace this pump assembly, you will only need a Philips-head screwdriver, but should start by removing your dishwasher racks. Then, pull up on the lower spray arm, and drain trap to remove them. Next, rotate the spray arm support and pull that up to remove it, at which point you can remove the base and filter for the drain pump. With those out, you can use your Philips-head screwdriver to disconnect and remove the cover and drain pump assembly. With the pump removed, you can inspect it or install the new drain pump assembly, with the same hardware as before. Then it is as simple as reassembling the rest of your dishwasher, ensuring each connection point is fastened tightly.\n",

      "Last week, my dishwasher would not drain. Checking first for a clog, I pulled out the end of the drainpipe and blew into it to try to clear out any clogs. It took a while but eventually it made it through to the dishwasher basin. But it still didnt drain.\n\nI then removed the drainpipe and re-attached. I never found anything that would clog it. But when I reassembled it, it worked. But again yesterday it stopped draining again. But I would try to re-attach some of the wires and it would eventually work. But sometimes would stop in the middle of running, with lights flashing or it all would go dark. Again, I'd \"play\" with the wire connections underneath a bit and it would eventually run through. I have no idea if any of my write-adjusting is having an effect or not.\n\nBased on my search here, it may need a drain pump assembly replaced, but is there any other troubleshooting I can do before I go that route to be sure that is the issue?\n\nThank you for your time - I appreciate the assistance.Hello Aaron, thank you for contacting us. Before replacing the drain pump, we would recommend checking the wire connections of the pump and making sure no connection is loose or damaged. Also, check the drain pump filter, part number PS11770489, and ensure that it is not damaged or clogged. If this does not help, replacing the drain pump, part number PS8689824, is the most likely solution. Customer service is always available to help you place an order if you are having trouble doing so. Good luck with your repair.",

      "I changed the water filter in my fridge because the order and replace light went from green to red. Now that its been replaced how do I make the light go back to green? Will it reboot on its own?Hi Brian, after replacing the filter you can hold the reset filter pad for 3 seconds. This should turn the light off. Best of luck with this repair.",
      "My icemaker just stopped making ice and I know I need to replace the water filter ive just been dragging my feet about it. Is the icemaker cut off now because I need to replace my filter or is there another reason for it stopping now?Hello Jones, we recommend replacing the water filter every 6 months, depending on how often you use it. Replacing or not replacing the filter would only affect the water dispenser, not the icemaker. The most common reason an icemaker does not get water would be a defective water valve WPW10270395. I hope this helps.",
      "I just replaced my water filter on my Whirlpool gold however its making ice but its not dispensing water or ice. What van i do?Hi Ivan,\nThank you for your question.  If there is no water or ice being dispensed, I would check the switch in the dispenser with a multimeter to see if it is working correctly.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "How do you remove water filter?Hello Richard,\n\nThanks for your question. Open up the fridge section, and the filter will be in the back corner of the compartment. Open up the plastic covering. You will need to twist the filter counterclockwise, then remove it.\n\nI hope this helps.",
      "Our fridge section is too cold. Adjusting the digital thermostat does not seem to help much.Water filter replacement comes up as the #1 solution.How does the water filter function affect fridge temp? Does seem to make sense.  Thanks.Hi Steve, Thank you for the question, The suggestions are based on previous customers and what reason they gave for replacing a part. A customer replacing the filter may have clicked the wrong option in error. I suggest checking to make sure the Damper Control Assembly is not stuck open and allowing too much cold air through from the freezer. You can check to see if the flapper has froze open or if there is something blocking the flapper not allowing it to close.Hope this helps!",
      "I didn't know I had to replace my water filter in my fridge. How often do you recommend we replace them?Hi Jauna, we recommend replacing the water filter every 6 months to guarantee impurities are properly removed from your water, and there is a consistent flow rate. Please let us know if you have any further questions.",
      "My refrigerator is leaking water into the freezer. My model has the freezer on the bottom. Which part do you think i needHello Walter,\n\nThank you for the great question. Checking the symptom list something to check would be the water filter, If it needs to be replaced it might leak or if it is loose.You can also check to see if the reservoir tank at the back of the appliance has no leaks or the lines going to the tank. \n\nI hope this helps!",
      "The water filter cover keeps on opening and the filter keeps dropping down.  The little plastic clip is not holding the door in place.  I can't seem to find the part anywhere for my kitchen aide refrigerator.  I am using a soda bottle to  hold the filter in place.Hello Greg, Thank you for your inquiry. The latch or clip for the filter cover is part# WP2223877. Hope this helps!",
      "The install video does not show shutting the water.  Is it not necessary to shut off the water?Hi Charles,\nThank you for your question.  No, you will not need to turn the water off to perform this repair.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "When I opened the filter cover the filter did not drop down like it did in the video. It is lodged in the compartment. How do I release it?Hello Wayne, Thank you for the question. If the filter is stuck, you may need to remove the Filter bracket, Part #: PS2069868 and cover Part #: PS11743682 to remove the filter. I also suggest checking them for any damage causing the filter to get stuck. Hope this helps!"

      "What screw do I need for my refrigerator's GE Profile upper light shield?  I replaced a light bulb but it also looks like maybe my screw in front is broken that holds my light shield tight as it doesn't have a head or nut on it.Hello Brenda, thank you for writing. For your Light Shield PS291976, there is not a screw required. Please not how a customer described there install. Removed temperature knob in middle of old light shield. Pushed up on old light shield to remove it from its place. Replaced 40w light bulb on L. Replaced new light shield by making sure clips on top new light shield caught the pegs on the refrigerator. Pulled down slightly till new light shield was in place. No tools. We look forward to hearing from you.",
      "Where does part 847 go on the door of the refrigerator. It won't stay closed tight?  Also my freezer shelves keep collapsing what do i do to stop them from doing that?Hi Louisa,\n\nThank you for your question. To get to this part, you have to unscrew your kickplate grille at the bottom of your appliance. You should then be able to get to this spring underneath your fridge and change it. I am not sure why your bins would be collapsing. Perhaps you are filling them with too many things? or things that are too heavy? Good luck with your repair."

We suggest cleaning the Fine Filter, Drain Hose, Pump and Sump from any debris and build up preventing all of the water from draining before the end of the cycle. Make sure the Flapper on the Drain Pump is not damaged as well. If they are all good and clear, you may need to replace the Drain Pump.

Very sorry we do not have the electrical schematic, however you can ohm test it with a multimeter. It should measure 48K to 52K ohms at room temperature about 77*F. The sensor may also just need to be cleaned. These turbidity measurements are supplied to the dishwasher controller, which makes decisions on how long to wash in all the cycles. If faulty or dirty, it will effect the cycle length. If you need help placing an order, customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call.

If the unit is washing, starts draining, but then stops and turns off the issue is most likely the Motor and Pump Kit WD26X10013.

If the upper spray arm is getting enough pressure to spin quickly and spray the water consistently, I would recommend removing the spray arm and soaking it in warm soapy water. Make sure all of the holes in the spray arm are free of any debris. There is a filter on the unit, so you might also want to remove and clean the filter, part number W10872845. To access the filter, unplug the dishwasher. Open the dishwasher door. Reach in and pull out the lower rack until it is resting on the door, and then remove it and set it aside. Push down on the filter and twist it counterclockwise. Turn the filter until it stops moving, with the tabs released. Pull the filter out of the dishwasher and clean it. I hope this helps!"

      "Some where in the bottom of the dishwasher there is a leak when the washer is being ran, this dishwasher has been a pain in my you know what in the last 5 years I've had it, I have had it worked on 4 times.I am not sure if it is the repair man doesn't know anything or I got a lemon! Please help me fix this right! He says it needs either the part 14 or 1Hi LeeAnn, Thank you for the question. The only way to know for sure where the leak is coming from is to take the appliance apart and check for damage in the seals and parts int he bottom of the appliance.The most common fix for the leak in the bottom of the dishwasher is the small gasket in the middle of the sump (Part Number: PS11755006) that seals the shaft of the motor/diverter valve to the sump.Hope this helps!",
      "The sealing washer that the diverter shaft goes thru is leaking water.  How do we go about locating a replacement washer? Thank you....Hi Ed, Thank you for the question. The seal is only sold as part of the sump. In order to replace the seal the sump will need to be replaced. Hope this helps!",
      "I have a leak coming directly out of diffuser pump. The gasket in bottom of sump leaks. I have replaced the pump and the entire sump. I even called a repair service after that did not work and they said i probably got a faulting sump gasket. They ordered another sump and replaced it. I just put some water in the sump and it still drips. Did not even have to turn on dishwasher to see it leak. Any more ideas? I have over $300 dollars in this repair and am still without a solution after a month of waiting on parts.Hi Gerald,\nThank you for your question.  If the dishwasher is leaking on it own when it is off, the problem may be with the water inlet valve.  A component in the valve may not be working correctly and it could cause water to leak into the dishwasher and then leak out the bottom.  You will need to test the water inlet valve with a multimeter to see if it is working correctly.  The water inlet valve on your dishwasher is normally located to the left side behind the lower access panel. Remove the screws that secure the access panel and locate the valve. Inspect the inlet supply connection to the valve for leaks and tighten if required or replace the connector if damaged. Most modern dishwashers use compression style fittings or hoses that can be replaced easily. Remember to turn off the water supply before attempting this repair. Check the body of the valve and the outlet hose for cracks or damage. If there is evidence of a leak in the inlet valve area but it is not present during your inspection, try starting a cycle and observe the valve area while the dishwasher is filling. Use caution when attempting this repair as there will be live voltage in this area and any repair or parts replacement should only be attempted after power has been removed.\n\nIf your dishwasher is leaking because it has overflowed, the water inlet valve may be the cause. A mechanical defect inside of the valve could cause it to stay open even after the float switch has been satisfied. If your dishwasher continues to fill above the heating element, try opening the door latch to see if it stops filling. If it continues to fill, then you have a defective inlet valve that will need to be replaced.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "Dishwasher is leaking from the bottom when running a cycle as it is draining. We think it is the sump as it is not constantly leaking. Should we replace just this part or change the motor as well (the motor seems to be running ok). The dishwasher is 4 years old.Hello Rosanna, thank you for inquiring.

      "I have replaced the diverted valve twice and it is still leaking from where the shaft on the diverted protrudes up into the motorHi Fredric,\nThank you for your question.  If the dishwasher is still leaking in the area where the shaft protrudes up through the sump, the diverter seal is likely worn and it will need to be replaced.  The seal is not sold separately and is only sold with the sump.  The part number listed under your model number for the sump is PS11755006.  If you would like to place an order for it, you may order it either online or by calling our customer service line and anyone will be happy to assist you.  We hope this helps!

In order to help we will need to know the symptoms of the appliance. Once we have more information we will be happy to help you trouble shoot the issue and suggest any parts that you mat need. Please note, we are not GE and we do not cover their warranty on appliances. PartSelect is an online website that sell appliance parts. Look forward to hearing from you!",
      "I'm still not getting hot water (the water is probably 130 degrees) nor are the dishes drying.  I checked the heating element with multi-meter and it shows 17ohm for continuity.  I didn't know how to check the flood switch assembly with a multi-meter so i'm not sure about it.  I did remove the flood switch and clean it (it had a lot of \"gunk\" built up in it that only removed when i placed it under boiling hot water).  How would i check the flood switch with a multi-meter to know if i need to replace it?  Also, would there be any other parts i should check to fix the no hot water and not drying problem? Thank you very much!Hi Eric, \n\nThank you for your question. We have a page that details how you can test that switch: https://www.partselect.com/Dishwasher+test-float-switch+repair.htm . However this switch usually has to deal with your appliance being able to fill with water and drain the water. You have checked your heating element, the only other part that it may be is the electronic control board. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "The original problem was no water, tested the inlet valve and it was fine, replaced the float switch and dishwasher is filling with water. Now my problem is that there is no heating, meaning its not drying the dishes, tested the heating element and it test fine 16ohms. I can not seem to see any temperature sensor, according to the web the float switch has two functions, float switch and thermistor; having replace it twice with out a change in heating i'm inclining towards the control board. Its there any other part on this dishwasher that would cause not to heat (dry)?Hello Julio, thank you for your question. If the heating element and float switch have been replaced, and the valve is allowing hot water into the unit the control board is the most likely issue that is causing the heating element to not function properly. I hope this helps!"

      "Leaking between door panel and lower stationary panel. Not sure what part should be replaced. Problem could be linning. Just not sure,Hello Elwood, thank you for your question. We would recommend replacing the door gakset Part #: PS958908, and the corner baffles PartSelect Number: PS263963 and PartSelect Number: PS263964. If that doesn't fix the issue, the unit may be getting too much water in which case the float switch and valve should be tested/replaced. I hope this helps!",

      "I need to replace both the door gasket & the gasket insert on the dishwasher that came with the house. Which should I replace first or does it matter? Does the gasket insert go under, over, or into the door gasket?Hello Mary, thank you for your query. The gasket compatible with your model is part number PS958908 and the gasket insert is part number PS258653. The gasket insert is connected to the gasket at the bottom of your dishwasher door. It is a small piece of white plastic that measures approximately 4 inches by 1 inch and is sold individually. The gasket insert helps the gasket create a seal on the door, so water does not leak out when the dishwasher is running. We have included relevant videos for you to replace the gasket and the gasket insert. Usually, the gasket is installed first and the gasket insert is installed after it. We hope this helps!"

      "The question wasn't weather part #1 came with part #9.  The question was does part #1 include the gasket for the two holes where part #9 slips into.  I also need that gasket since there are two holes to seal shut and part #9 only slips into one of them.  So, is there a way to get one of those gaskets to seal off the two holes on part #1?Hi Ray, Thank you for contacting us back. Sorry for the mix up there. Yes the tube comes with the gaskets that fit into the 2 holes on the tube that #9 slips into.Unfortunately the gaskets are not sold separately from the feed tube assembly. Hope this helps!",
      "I think i understand what benjamin meant when he wrote \"double hole runner gasket flapper thingies\". Please confirm: Do i need to buy then entire feed tube assembly, if only the double flapper gasket (held within the feed tube) is broken? The broken part was taken out of the feed tube. It is about 3\" long, about 1\" wide, and looks like a tiny pair of grey rubber glasses with flaps over the lenses. Am i making sense here? Anyway, can i just get this little double flapper valve, by itself, to insert into the perfectly good feed tube? Or do i have to get the whole feed tube? Thank you.Hello Ann, thank you for inquiring. It is only included with this Feed Tube with 3rd Level Spinner replacement for your model.",
      "Does part #1 (water feed tube) come with the double hole runner gasket flapper thingies that allow you to insert the second level rack at different heights?Hi Benjamin,\n\nThank you for your question. It does not come with part number 9 however it does come with your upper spinner. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Hello, there is no water coming out of the top white spinner in our dishwasher, i thought maybe the water feed tube needs replacing but do you think that is might be the issue or is there hose connecting behind the housing that may be the problem? Or is there a missing part on the water feed tube? I see a square whole so i'm not sure how the water gets fed up to the spinner..Hello Amber, Thank you for your inquiry. We would recommend checking first to make sure the spinner arm and feed tube are not clogged. If you are getting water to the middle tube but not the upper tube, there may be a clog or crack in the tube. We would also recommend checking the manifold and water inlet valve. Hope this helps!",
      "The glasses in the top rack are not getting clean on the inside of the glass. What do we check first?Hi Lila. You will want to check the lower spray arm. Check to make sure nothing is clogged or gunked  up and the seals are not damaged. Thank you for your question and good luck with your repair.",
      "Looking at the feed tube and the flap on the upper of the two opening looks like it isn't closing as I think it was designed.  Should I assume the upper spinner isn't getting much water pressure?  Would that lead to the machine being noisier than it was?Hi Mark,\nThank you for your question.  If the dishwasher has low water pressure, then water may not come out of the top spinner.  Check both the water pressure and the water inlet valve.  If the water inlet valve is not working correctly, then it may not provide water to the dishwasher.  Look for any signs of damage, wear, or cracking, visually inspect the water inlet valve. If your valve shows signs of any of the symptoms described above, you will need a replacement water inlet valve. If the spinner or the spray arms are clogged, then water will not spray out of them.  You will need to remove and inspect them.  If they are clogged, give the a good cleaning and use a pin to clean the holes.   We hope this helps!  If you have any questions, please let us know.",
      "It's difficult to see through the dishwasher door, but the glasses and anything in the top rack doesn't come out clean. When I open the door while the dishwasher is running, it looks like the middle sprayer is not turning. When I pull out the top rack the rubber flap that closes the hole when not in use doesn't flap back to seal the hole. I tried plugging that hole with a plastic cap and lower the rack to use the lower hole with the flap but again, the sprayer isn't turning. Is replacement part #1 the one I should purchase to fix this problem or are their other parts in play? Thank you.Hi Rafik, thank you for the question. Before replacing the water feed tube, we would suggest checking the middle spray arm and center support for any damage. If these are fine, the issue could be with the manifold probe, part number PS11748182. It supplies water from the main water feed tube to the middle manifold water tube. You may need to replace it to fix the issue. We hope that helps!"

      "The heating element in my washer isn’t working. There seems to be no voltage coming from the control board to the element. Is there anything else I should check before ordering the control board?Hello Garrett, Thank you for the question. I suggest testing the High Limit Thermostat, PartSelect Number PS11743423. This part acts as as safety mechanism that keeps the dryer from overheating. Once the dryer temperature reaches a certain point, this part will shut down power to the heating element. You can test it with a multimeter to see if it has continuity. I would also double check the wiring going to the heating element for any visible damage. Hope this helps!",
      "Our dishwasher does not complete it's wash cycle. It will run about half way and then stop with the button flashing.  If I hit the wash button again it will finish washing the dishes.  Do I need to replace the control circuit board?  It works fine when I use the one hour cycle.Hi Robert, as best as we can guess it does seem like a control board issue. Thank you for your question and good luck with your repair!"

If the lights are blinking on the control panel, this may indicate that the heating element has burned out, the drain pump is not working correctly or the touchpad and control panel may be defective and you will need to test the parts with a multimeter to see which part is causing the issue.

When your appliance will not turn on there are a few parts that you need to check to see if they are working correctly. You should take a look at your bi metal fuse, your door switch, and your high limit thermostat. If all of those parts are working correctly. Then it may be your control board that is the issue.

Based on what you described, it sounds like the problem is with the electronic control board.  If you wanted to verify if it was either the touchpad or the electronic control board that was causing the issue, you would need to use a multimeter to test the continuity of each part.  If it turns out that these two parts are not causing the issue, there are some parts that you will need to check.

If the washer is not draining as it should, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.

      "I have identified the part (i think) i need. It is the switch interlock assembly. It looks like it is hard wired in the dishwasher or does it have wire plugs? Thanks!Hi Wayne, \nThank you for your question.  Before you begin any repair please turn the power supply off to your dishwasher.  To replace the interlock switch assembly, your first step is to remove the screws securing the inner and outer door panels together.  Once the screws have been removed separate the 2 panels.  Now close the inner panel and secure it with the latch.  Remove the mounting screws securing the old door switch assembly and release it.  Unsnap the cover and remove the 2 switches. Disconnect the wires and set the old switches and housing aside.  Install the new door switch assembly by first unsnapping the cover and removing the door switches.  Connect the wires to the new switches and position the switches in the housing and then snap the cover closed.  Position the new assembly on the outer door panel and secure it with the screws.  Realign the inner and outer door panels and secure them with the screws.  Restore power to the dishwasher and the dishwasher should now work for you.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "I just replaced the float switch because it was malfunctioning(no continuity when activated).  Now when i close the door and try to start a cycle the breaker trips.  Any suggestions please on where to start trouble shooting? ThanksHi Joey,\nThank you for your question.  If the dishwasher is tripping the breaker, it could be caused by a number of things.  If the dishwasher is plugged into a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) and the outlet senses a circuit overload, it will cause the circuit to trip.  Always make sure it is plugged into a regular outlet.  If water is leaking from the dishwasher or there is excess humidity coming from the dishwasher will cause the breaker to trip.  There may be an issue with the dishwasher power cord.  If there is a short in the power cord or any exposed wires, then the breaker will trip.  Faulty wiring in the dishwasher will cause the breaker to trip.  Also, check the circuit breaker itself, to see if there are any issues with it.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "Hi again,  i have no power reading at two-terminal harness at pump.  I do have continuity between terminals on pump and the harness. I do get a power reading(120v) between one terminal on harness and dishwasher metal body.  Could this be a control board issue or possibly the door switch?  Unit not tripping breaker now, but dishwasher will not run a full cycle, lights/timer go off on led screen.  Still not getting water, so maybe something is heating up and shutting unit down. Suggestions? ThanksHi Joey,\nThank you for your question.  If the other parts are working correctly, then you should test the door switch and the electronic control board to see if these parts are causing the issue.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "Do you have an instruction video for replacement of my dishwasher switch interlock assembly (ps783632)?Hi Jay, Thank you for your question.

      "The dishes in the upper rack aren't being cleaned well. The pump seems to run well, i can see water coming up the rear tube and into the center outlet during one of the cycles. It later speeds up and water goes all the way to the top outlet as well. My upper rack arm boot and outlet gasket all look ok. Could they still be an issue?Hi V,\nThank you for your question.  If the dishes in the upper rack are not getting clean, there are a few things that you will need to check to see what is causing the issue.  If the dishwasher does not have enough water pressure then water may not reach the upper spray arm.  Check the water pressure in your home to see if there are any issues and also check the hoses to make sure that they are not bent or clogged.  If the upper spray arm is clogged with food or detergent residue, you will need to clean it. Use a sharp tool like a steel wire or a metal hanger to clean the holes and then soak the arm in vinegar to remove any residue that is inside it.  If the upper spray arm seal breaks, this will cause a leak and prevent the water from spraying from the upper arm.  Check the seal and if it is damaged, replace it.  We hope this helps!  Good luck with the repair!",

      "Our dishwasher was getting little or no water flowing during washing. We removed the filter assembly (part 451) to clean it and found it was full of crud. We cleaned out most of the crud and tried to remove the remaining crud around the flood switch (308), then ran it again this morning. I listened and thought i heard some water running, but when i opened it after the cycle finished, it was still dry, and most or all of the dishwasher liquid residue left from the previous failure to clean was still here. I tried turning the flood switch, and was able to twist is up to about 90 degrees, but it did not come out. Is this likely to be a flood switch problem, and if i need to replace it, how can i get it out? -- thanks, jeff hechtHello Jeff, Thank you for your inquiry. The two parts we would recommend checking to solve this issue are the flood switch and water inlet valve. You can test the parts with a multimeter. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, there are YouTube videos available to assist you. To remove the flood switch, You will have to remove the lower rack, remove the lower wash arm, remove the lower coarse filter, removed fine filter, and you may have to remove the filter adaptor as well. Removed two 1/4\" head screws with nut driver to then remove float switch, unplugged float switch, plugged in new switch, and reverse the process. Hope this helps!",

Would any of this have caused the unit to not draw water?  Also, do i have to remove the unit to work on the flood switch or can it be done in place/Hi Paula,\n\nThank you for your question. It sounds like you  may need to take a look at your water inlet valve. That would be my first go to for what would not be bringing water into your appliance. You should be able to test that valve with a multi meter. Yes you would have to remove the unit to get to the valve and check the flood switch as well. I hope that helps.

Remove the twist and lock fine filter and the course filter.  Remove the tab lock filter adapter by pulling up on the adapter. Remove any water in the sump area. Remove the two 1/4 in. hex head screws holding the floor plate and flood switch and remove the floor plate and flood sensor. Lift the sensor and floor plate out of sump. Remove the harness to the flood switch assembly. Reverse the steps to install replacement part. Hope this helps!",
      "My dishwasher is only 2 years old but doesn't dry the dishes now, they used to come out scolding hot when it was done. Now they are drenched and sometimes smell from sitting wet too long.  I tested the element and it tested good, but i still went ahead and replaced it to make sure it wasn't the problem. It still doesn't dry the dishes. I was told by a friend that it may be the high limit thermostat. I remember seeing something like that in connection with the element underneath but i can't find the part number anywhere to replace it. Any other ideas on how to get the part number or other ideas of what it could be??\nthank youHello Chaz, thank you for your question.

      "Hey all!  Trying to avoid getting soaked with a repair bill on my GE profile dishwasher, hoping to get a bit of insight or confirmation that the flood switch is the most likely problem.  We've had the dishwasher for about 4 years, did not really do much maintenance at all until recently when the dishes starting coming out wet.  Cleaned out the filter at the bottom of the unit, which was quite loaded up with residue, but would still pass water \"pretty well\".  Neither the type of cycle selected, \"power dry\" setting, nor the temp of the input water (by running sink until hot) has any noticeable effect.Thanks for your help!\n\ntoddHi Todd, thank you for your question. The flood switch can sometimes cause this issue, however most of the time the first part to check is actually the heating element for your appliance. That part tends to be the issue more times than not. You can test that part with a multi meter. The element should be reading between 0 - 50 ohms of resistance to be in working condition. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Hello there, yesterday I started the cycle on the dishwasher came back into kitchen about 1/2 hour later and there was water all over the floor.  When opening the door water came flooding out the front door on both sides, pulled the dishwasher out, checked pipe no blockage, had pipe in sink started rinse cycle, water had no problem going up pipe and into sink.  I thought the problem was solved, bu I started the wash cycle, about 15 - 20 minutes in the cycle, the water once again started coming out but this time it seemed like it was coming out just under and behind the door.  Help, I am going through a lot of towels. LOL!  Thank you for any help. Sincerely,  JanetteHi Janette,\nThank you for your question. If the dishwasher is leaking, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the gasket, the gasket tub plastic, the water valve assembly, the door vent seal, the hose loop drain, the diverter assembly and the drain pump.  I hope this helps.

What is the most likely cause--door switch, thermal fuse, control panel? I do not have a continuity tester to check.Hello Robert, Thank you for the question. If there are no lights, this is more then likley the control board, PartSelect Number PS11722936. Hope this helps!",

If the door switch is defective would it prevent the touch pad from operating?  Thank you.Hi Robert,\nThank you for your question.  If the dishwasher is still not working after replacing the main control board, verify that everything is fitted and connected correctly to the new board, if everything is connected correctly, then the door latch is just one part you will need to check. There are some other parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  Here is a link from our website that you may reference on what other parts to check, https://www.partselect.com/AdvancedModelSymptoms.aspx?ModelNum=WDF510PAYS6&mfgModelNum=&fkMfgID=3&ModelMasterID=368960&PID=40.

What part would I need .Hi Joe, Thank you for the question. I suggest testing the board and motor. You will need to access the control board while the unit running and check to see if there is intermittent power going to the wash motor. The pins for the wash motor on the control board would be P3 for the main winding, P5 for the drain winding and P4 for the wash winding of the motor. If you check from the wash winding to the P7 neutral, there should be a constant 120 vac while in the wash mode. Hope this helps!",

      "Dishwasher wont start. The switches in the door latch appear to be working. How do i test the control board to see if thats the problem. I thought it could have been a timer problem but i dont see a timer in the parts list. For the last few months washer only started when it wanted to. Would have no lights for days then my wife would see lights, do her happy dance and it would run a full cycle. Now it hasnt started in over a weekHi John,\n\nThank you for your question. Unfortunately only a technician can really test an electronic control board. However I would suggest just quickly testing the ribbon between your touch pad and your board. Unplug your ribbon and using a multimeter test between the prongs of 6 and 10 on your ribbon. There should be a little arrow or number on one side of your ribbon. That will indicate that the prong next to that is number one. So you can work from there. If your ribbon is testing fine, then you will have to replace your control board. Good luck with your repair.",

You should be able to test those parts with a multi meter to check if they are working correctly. Otherwise it may be your board. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Lights on control panel are all flashing at once. Washer starts and then stops for a few seconds and keeps starting and stopping. Shut power off to try to reset for 5 min. And washer continues to do the same thing ??\nthank you !Hi Jim,\nThank you for your question.  If the lights are all blinking and the dishwasher is shutting off and on, the issue may be the heating element.  If the water temperature is not getting as high as it should, this can cause the lights on the control panel to go on and off.  I would also check the door latch and the electronic control board as well to see which part is causing the issue.  To test the parts, you will need to use a multimeter.  If you are not sure how to use one, here is a link to one of our videos from YouTube that you may reference on how to use a multimeter, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWC44fHn0As.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",

The capacitive touch buttons on your dishwasher are very sensitive. While loading and unloading the dishwasher, brushing ( maybe a cat ) against the control panel could set a cycle.\nIf that is not the case then the control board  PS2004004might be faulty and needs to be replaced.\nWe hope this helps.

You should first test the door switches on your door latch to see if they are working correctly. If they are not your control board will not receive any power. You should also check your turbidity sensor. You can test all of those parts with a multi meter. If all of those parts are fine, you may have to look at your control board as being the issue.

      "Kitchen aid dishwasher 6 yrs old...replaced thermal fuse 3 weeks ago which seemed to fix my problem (no lights no power on inside door panel)...but now same thing happening again (no lights no power on inside door panel)...have not removed door panel to inspect thermal fuse, but will do so today).  if the thermal fuse is out again, what other problem may be occurring to cause this ripple effect?  i do not want to keep replacing thermal fuses every 3 weeks.  thank you for your input.Hello Darrell, thank you for your question. If the thermal fuse is still good, the problem is probably the electronic control board that is the issue. I hope this helps!",
      "Hello: I have a KitchenAid dishwasher with model no: Kudc10ixss1. If the buttons do not respond,  i shut off the power and turn it back on after 10 to 15 minutes.. then it works. lately, it no longer works and the cancel/drain light indicator is always on with a blue dim/low light. there was also a time that when i press the normal wash, heated dry and start buttons, it blinks and lights shuts off and after a few seconds, the washer will start running. please advise what parts shall i need to replace. thanks!Hi Anand, Thank you for the question. This would indicate there is an issue with the Electronic Control Board, Part Number: PS11753985 and it will need to be replaced. Hope this helps!",

      "Can a faulty door latch kill power to the dishwasherHi Joyce, thank you for your question. Yes, if the micro switches are not working then it will not allow power to go to your control board as it believes that the door is open. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",

      "My door opens during cleaning . The unit is level , all lights work heat cycle works. I have to reset power switch after each use to reset the unit . Do i need control panel and a door switch or just control panelHi David, thank you for your question. I would suggest first checking your door switch for an issue. It  sounds like that part is not locking correctly. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "My 2012 jenn air dishwasher jdb8200aws0 will stop after having been on for 15 seconds. 1/.  I have shut the power off for 2 minutes (tripped the circuit breaker at the house panel) to reset/reboot  the control module.  2/. Re-engaged the house panel cb, power is then restored to the dishwasher control panel as the lights come on.  3/. I select a programme, the dishwasher starts, then stops in 15 seconds.  I have repeated this several times.  I am fairly certain this is not the micro switch in the latch mechanism but probably the control module circuit board.  Q1/. Does this sound correct to you?  Q2/. What is the the part number for the control module for a 2012 jenn air jdb8200aws0.  Any other advice or troubleshooting tips would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.Hi Chris,\nThank you for your question.  If the dishwasher is shutting off after a few seconds, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the door latch, the door balance link kit, the turbidity sensor, the electronic control board, the drain pump, the overfill control switch, the thermostat and the wiring.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "My Whirlpool dishwasher works fine but when finished washing the door sticks at the top and needs to be pried open with a screwdriver. The door seems to latch fine for washing. Is the problem the latch or something else?Hello Wayne, Thank you for the question. If it latched normally when closed and it can be pried open, the latch sounds like it is ok. I suggest checking to see if the hinges are bent and the door is sitting level. Hope this helps!"

The thermistor is part of the sensor mounted in the tub.You will need a Multi Meter to check for resistance. The resistance should be between 46K and 52K ohms of resistance at 77 degrees.Sorry I am not sure what caused the thermistor  to go bad, it could have been just a defective part. Hope this helps!",
      "Kitchen aid dishwasher - no power so I checked the thermal fuse - no continuity so I purchased a new fuse kit - powered back up just fine.  Ran a normal wash with energy saver dry - dishwasher ran through a couple of cycles fine and then stopped - clean light is blinking seven times then repeats.  I tried to reset by touching hi-temp scrub button the energy saver dry button 5 times but it will not clear.  Could it be the thermistor or the control board or?Hi Gerard, Thank you for the question. The most common reasons for this error is because the water coming from your household is just too cold.  The dishwasher is expecting 110 degree water to enter your dishwasher, so if your pipes are cold, the water may only come in luke warm.  To correct this issue, just run your faucet next to the dishwasher until the water coming out is hot. Hope this helps!",

      "Where exactly is the WP8269208 thermistor? How do I access it?  Could it be the cause of the thermal fuse blowing consistently? Appreciate any help!Hi K, thank you for the question. Based on our research, the thermistor could be the cause of thermal fuse blowing. The thermistor is mounted in the tub. We have found the instructions to access the thermistor. These may not be of the same model but will help you to access it. You may need to follow these steps: \n1. Using a screwdriver, un-thread the mounting screws securing the panels at the bottom front.\n2. Remove both panels and set them aside.\n3. Un-thread the screws securing the terminal box cover.\n4. Un-thread the water supply line from the water supply valve\n5. Disconnect the drain hose from the sink drain.\n6. Open the dishwasher door and remove the mounting screws.\n7. Un-thread the screws securing the thermistor to the sump.\n8. Pull the thermistor out.\nWe hope this information helps!"

      "We cannot remove the bottom spray arm to see if there is something stuck causing he loud noise the dishwasher is making.  We tried unscrewing the bolt?? on top but it just keeps turning forever and not releasing the arm - please help.  thank you.Hi Jackie,\nThank you for your question.  There is a video on our website that you can reference on how to install the lower spray arm.  The dishwasher and part in the video may not show exactly like the ones you have, but it will give you a general idea on how to install the part.  You will find the video under part number PS260529.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",

Does the new spray arm come with a nut to fix it in place in case i break the nut on the old one as i try to remove the spray arm?Hi Allan, thank you for your question. It does not. However here is a video that will show you how to remove that nut: https://youtu.be/3RE9Vo_8bBM. Good luck with your repair."

      "I need to replace what looks like part A159 or A165.  I cannot tell from the drawing the difference between the two.  There are 4 of them on my upper rack that are attached to the end of the rack with blue pieces of plastic.  These parts are all corroded.  Also is this for a single piece or do they come in pairs? Thank you.Hi Susan,\nThank you for your question.  The 2 tine racks are different.  For A159, the tine at one end is a quarter inch long and at the other end the tine is approximately 3 inches long and bends slightly outwards. All if the tines on this tine rack are slightly curved.  For A165, the tine on one end is approximately a little over an inch long and is curved outwards while the rest of the tines are perfectly straight.  Based on the diagram, you would need 2 each and they are sold individually.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "Is this the bottom rack or is this just parts to the bottom rack? Thank youHi Travis, thank you for your question. This part is not a rack at all. It is a set of tines. Good luck with your repair.",

Can you tell me which part it might be?  LG inverter direct drive.Hello Suzy, Thank you for contacting us. I have researched the model you have provided and have found the part you are looking for is PartSelect Number PS7796046. Hope this helps!"

Replacing this part should clear up that smell. Good luck with your repair!",

      "What is the purpose of the shield that is with the heating element? We replaced our heating element dishwasher still not getting hot enough to dry and sanitize. Would the next step be replace the thermostat?Hi Kim,\n\nThank you for your question. Yes, I would suggest testing the thermostat with a multi meter to check if it is working correctly or not. When testing the part it should read 0 ohms. If that part is fine, you may want to check your wiring for any damage. If your wiring is fine it may actually be your control board that is the issue. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

      "The blue plastic piece has snapped off.  How I do I remove it from its place to insert the new piece?Hello Joann,\n\nUnplug the dishwasher. Open the door and remove the front panel's side screws. Close the door\ncarefully, and when it is upright, pull the door down to release it from the control panel, then\nset it aside. Use tape to hold the white piece on the dispenser intact. Use a screwdriver\nto press on the blue button to push it past the prongs, then open the dishwasher door. Remove\nthe detergent lid by sliding it. Take off the latch and slide the lid off. Use a screwdriver\nto pry out the detergent cup latch. When it is released, lift it out and remove the orange\nseal underneath it. Reverse this process to install the part.\n\nI hope this helps.",
      "My detergent lid no longer closes in a locked position prior to starting a wash but the spring assembly seems to be functioning as it should. Will a simple spring replacement kit fix this issue or will I need to replace the whole dispenser assembly? Thanks.Hi Ron,\nThank you for your question.   Replacing the spring should help with this.  The spring is part of the tripping device, part number PS8697162.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

      "I am trying to find out if you can clean the sump pump on my dishwasher, if yes how? How to test motor without removal, such as multi-meter. Thanks DanHello Daniel, Thank you for the question. In order to test the motor, it will need to be disconnected and removed from the appliance. With a multimeter, check resistance on the motor pins P5 to P9, you should read 3-7 ohms. Here is a link to a video that may help with cleaning the Sump area. We hope this helps! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtFu8e7MQ-8&t=254s"

I am not able to tell you how hard it is as it depends on your skill level. First remove the appliance from the water and power supply. Next removed the racks, screens and impeller inside and then lay it back on its side to access the motor. Unplug the wire harness from the motor. A flat head screw driver may help.Unscrew and disconnect the single wires on the side,taking note of where they go. Taking pictures will help. Remove the screws holding the motor in place. Once the screws are removed the motor will just pull out. Reverse the steps to reinstall. Hope this helps!",

      "There does not seem to be any water coming out of the upper spray arm. I took it off and cleaned it, it still does not work. The dishes in the top rack are not wet. Also, there is an FE code showing. Can you help?Hello Richard,\n\nThanks for your question. The FE error code indicates a fill error. The water inlet valve could be the cause of this issue. Consider testing the valve with a multimeter for electrical continuity and replace it if it shows no continuity. Examine the mesh filter as well for any signs of wear and tear.\n\nI hope this helps.",
      "I am looking to replace the full wash assembly, there was rusted metal parts and i had the le error code.  When i checked for a clog i noticed the rusted bits.  I would like to replace the full motor assembly not just the motor.  What part number would that be?Hello Shanna, thank you for your question. The assembly would be PartSelect Number PS3579321. This is the Dishwasher pump and motor assembly with pump housing gasket. The assembly includes a turbidity sensor in the pump housing. I hope this helps!",
      "LG dishwasher with an le error code, reset by powering down for approx. 5 minutes still get the le error code, could it be something preventing the motor from turning or is it just a motor failure?Hi Richard, Thank you for the question. The LE error code is an indication of a Motor issue. The issue that may cause this fault code is a wiring problem, the impeller of washing pump is locked, the rotor of washing motor is locked, the blade is locked, or the PCB main control board is faulty. If you can provide the model number of the appliance we will be able to pull up more details. Hope this helps!",
      "Hello, my dishwasher is making a grinding sound when in wash mode.  I am asssuning the motor is going bad.

      "Is there a way to bench test the motor to make sure it is the culprit for my le code \nCan i use a multimeter to determine if it is a bad partHello Erik, thank you for your question. You can test this Circulation Motor Assembly with a multi-meter. Test the ohms of resistance. Any reading over 100 is a good reading meaning the Motor is in working condition. Good luck with your repair!",
      "I have a hot electrical smell and code le on display. I can reset it and it will work again but the smell is still present. Water is spraying and arm seems to be spinning.Good Day Corey. Thank you for your question in regards to your unit (Model Number LDS5560ST). Based on our research the LE code on your unit is a sign that it has detected a Motor Error. Some of the most common reasons for this are the following: 1) There is a wiring issue and the wiring harness (PartSelect Number PS7790912) may need to be replaced. 2) The impeller on the washing pump is locked. 3) The Control Board (PartSelect PS8749407) has become faulty and may need to be replaced. We hope this helps! Best Regards.",
      "Error LE is displayed. Do you think that the Circulation motor needs to be replaced?Hello Nate, Thank you for the question. The LE is a Drain Pump Motor Error. This can be caused by the impeller of pump being locked/jammed. We suggest checking to make sure there is no debris or damage preventing the impeller from spinning. If it looks ok, you can check the wiring for any damage. If everything looks good, the Drain Pump may need to be replaced. We hope this helps!"

The most common is the chopper assembly, if this part is not working it is not chopping up the particles of food into small pieces to prevent the dishwasher pump from clogging. You can also try removing the circulation pump to see if it has been clogged and if it needs to be cleaned. \n\nWe also recommend checking the Sump Pump Check Valve,This valve allows the water to flow in the drain direction only and prevents the dirty water from coming back into the tub. If this part is damaged or missing it might be letting the dirty water back in and onto the dishes. \n\nHope this helps!"

      "Bosch dishwasher just hums after starting, i assume this the drain pump i'm hearing?, and does not continue ie: No water fill and no washing.  Replaced water inlet but after a few washes, same thing.  Replaced water fill control valve, washed once and same thing.  I have discovered that banging my fist on the interior of the dishwasher in the neighborhood of the control valve and then starting....works!  there is no water in the overflow tray, dry as a bone.  can't figure why it is stuck in drain mode, or whatever the humming noise might be, and does not begin a cycle without me pounding on it.Hello Gary, Thank you for the question. This sounds like an issue with the Control Unit in the panel, PartSelect Number PS8730628. It could be a lose wire or a defective board. Hope this helps!",

I question if solenoid is not actuating, or water fill sensor assembly area would be the issue.Suggestions?  Troubleshooting sequence?  Thanks.Hi Scot,\nThank you for your question.  If the dishwasher will not fill with water, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which ones are causing the issue.  You will need to check the water inlet valve and the float switch.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",

The Sump Assembly includes the Circulation Pump but not the Drain Pump PS11706890. A common reason for a Dishwasher to make a  squealing or droning or grinding sound is often due to worn-out bearings inside the wash pump or drain pump.

Is it possible to have bought a bad filter.Hello Jean , Thank you for the question. It is more then likely the off brand filter. For proper operation and use of the dispenser, we recommend using the proper Whirlpool filter. If you need help placing an order, customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you!",

Is there a way to remove it and put it back without damaging it, or should i try to slide the unit out with the gasket in place? If there is a way to send a picture i can do that. Thank you, billHi Bill, \n\nThank you for your question. Actually you do not have to remove that gasket at all when pulling out your dishwasher. To remove the gasket, you actually have to remove your mounting brackets at the top of your dishwasher and then pull the machine out a little bit. You would then slide the left and right sides up from your dishwasher and then pull your gasket off. I hope that helps! Good luck with your repair.",

The door handle is stuck pushed in and is not releasing and will not lock in.  I appreciate your help.  I look forward to hearing from you.Hi Tami,\nThank you for your question.  If the door handle is stuck and you are having difficulties with the door locking, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the door balance link kit, the door handle, the door release spring, the detergent dispenser assembly and the door latch bracket. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",

Our research indicates that the issue is probably with the Door Latch, part number PS11756967.

      "I can't seem to get one of the spade connectors off my existing element. The dishwasher was leaking around one of the leads so the connector might be corroded. Is there a clip I'm missing or should it just pull right off?Hi Stephen,\nThank you for your question.  For this repair you will need to use a Phillips head screwdriver and a ½ inch wrench.  Before beginning any repair, please turn the water off and either unplug the appliance or turn the circuit breaker off.   To begin the repair, open the door and remove the lower dishrack.   Then remove the lower spray arm by pulling it straight up.   Use the screwdriver to unthread the screws securing the dishwasher to the counter and then pull the dishwasher out half-way.   Then remove the wires from the heater terminals.  Take note of how they are positioned before removing them.  Then, with the half inch wrench, unscrew the mounting nuts securing the terminals.  Then pull out the old heater terminals and release the heater terminals from the retaining clips.  Install the new heater element terminals into the openings.  There should be 2 white dots on the heating element.  Where the white dots are positioned is where they slide into to the retaining clips.  Once the element has been placed into the clips, push the terminals down and reinstall and tighten the mounting nuts with the wrench.  Place the wires back onto the terminals and slide the dishwasher back into the counter.  Secure the dishwasher to the counter with the 2 screws.  Reinstall the lower spray arm and push it down to lock it in.  Place the lower rack back into the dishwasher and restore power and water to the dishwasher.  If you have any questions, please let us know.  We are open 7 days a week.  We look forward to hearing from you!",

      "How do i remove the old part and instal the new part?Hello Sandra, thank you for your question. Remove the bottom rack, and pull up on the lower spray arm. It will simply pop off the holder. The soil trap handle is then turned toward you so the handle is facing you. Lift the soil trap out of the unit. The spray arm holder is still attahed so it will have to be removed and reinstalled into the new soil trap. Reverse the steps to reinstall the parts into the dishwasher. I hope this helps!",
      "Were is the model & serial #'s found on my dishwasherHello Michael, thank you for the question. Here is a link to help you locate the model number sticker on the appliance. We hope this helps. \n\nhttps://www.partselect.com/Find-Your-Dishwasher-Model-Number.aspx",
      "I bought my house 7 months ago and water keeps backing up in dishwasher. I don’t even use it what could it be. I’ve had 2 technicians out and they can’t figure out. I have to run a cycle to clear it.Hi Rosalind,\nThank you for your question.  If you have your dishwasher hooked up to a garbage disposal, you will need to check the drain line.  Turn your disposal on to make sure it is clean and that it is draining correctly.  If it is draining correctly, remove the drain hose and inspect it for any clogs.  If there are no clogs, then the issue lies elsewhere.  If your dishwasher is not hooked up to a garbage disposal, you will need to check the air gap if your sink has one.  The air gap is located near your faucet.  If there is water leaking from it, then this is a sign that it is clogged.  Remove the cap and use a tube to blow air down into it to remove any debris that is trapped there.  If this is not the issue, then you will need to check the dishwasher drain.  If the drain is clogged this would be the reason why you still have water in your dishwasher.  You will need to clean it to resolve the issue.  We hope this helps!  If you have any questions, please let us know."

      "My normal light on the dishwasher keeps blinking and will not start.  Do i need to replace the control panel or is there some other fix that i can try?Hi Marilyn,\n\nThank you for your question. Usually behind the kickplate of your appliance, you should actually have a tech sheet attached to the back side. That tech sheet will have a diagnostic step by step procedure that you can use on your appliance to test the electronic control board. That may help you to determine which part is actually giving you the issue. There are a couple of parts that could cause the issue though. You could test your heating element with a multimeter to see if it has burnt out or not. The other two parts would be your control board and control panel. The diagnostic test should be able to tell you whether it is the control board or control panel that is the problem. hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "The pots and pans & normal light are blinking and the dishwasher will not start. Those two lights just remain blinking. What do you suggest?Hello A, thank you for your question. Try a hard reset on the dishwasher. To reset it, you will have to have the door open. It can not be latched. Press \"Heated Dry,\" \"Normal,\" \"Heated Dry,\" \"Normal\" within three seconds of the first pressed button. Now close the door, this should reset your dishwasher. If this doesn't work, you will want to try unplugging the unit or turning the power off to the unit then turning the power on to see if that resets it. If that doesn't work, you will want to start by testing the heating element, bi metal fuse, door switch, capacitor, turbidity sensor, and high limit thermostat. I hope this helps.",

Based on our research, the FED code, or flood error detection code, indicates a high water level in the dishwasher. To solve this issue, you may first need to make sure the filter is clean. If that is not causing the issue, then the pressure sensor, part number PS12741258, is most likely faulty and may need to be replaced. We hope this helps!",

      "Dish washer does not drain all the way. Leaves an inch or 2 of water after running. Impeller is fine. It mentions the float switch fixes this but all I see is it stops it from over filling. Not draining. ???Hi Jack, Thank you for the question. The most common reason to have standing water is because food debris has clogged up the drain system. I suggest taking the filter and sump out and the pump and giving them a good clean. Sometimes food debris can get into the float and will not allow it to close properly and allow water back into the tub. Hope this helps!",
      "I have a small leak around the float shaft. I removed the float and i did not find any dirt or crud. The float switch cycles the float up and down and the water leaks down the shaft. Is the float cycling switch or does the switch/arm cycle the float up and down.Hello Rick, Thank you for the question. I suggest testing the switch with a multi meter to check for continuity. It may not be closing the float properly. You can also check the Actuator Lever and Actuator Lever Pivot Pin for wear or damage. Hope this helps!",
      "No water enters the dishwasher. Could it be the water valve?Hi Curt,\n\nThank you for your question. That would be the first part that I would suggest you take a look at. You can test your water inlet valve with a multi meter to double check if the part is working correctly. If this part is working fine, you may want to look at your float switch. You can also test that part with a multi meter as well. Good luck with your repair.",
      "When testing inlet valve with a multi meter and your float switch. What should your meter read?Hi Liz,Thank you for the question. Test and see if there is power coming to the water valve on the unit. If there is power there, and your getting no water, you will need to order and replace the water valve on the unit.For the switch, NC to COM should read closed and NO to COM should read open. Hope this helps!",
      "Machine starts normal and runs for about 25 minutes, then it stops making and repeating a clicking sound like a motor trying to start.  The tub was full of hot water (not over full), i pushed the drain off button and it makes the same sound like it wants to begin pumping out.Hi Barry,\nThank you for your question.  There are some parts that you will need to check to see which ones are causing the issue.  You will need to check the electronic control board, the door latch assembly, the float switch, the limit switch, the motor and the pump.  You may test the parts with a multimeter.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "I have small leak(1/ 4 cup) per cycle from the float level shaft. I have checked the float switch   for continuity and it opens and closes the circuit. I removed the float and it is clean,  so is the shaft and shaft tunnel. What else might cause the leak. ?Hello Rick, thank you for inquiring. Check to see if the Actuator is stuck, as this will cause the dishwasher to fill with too much water and leak. The Palnut goes on about 1/4\" or so, just enough to keep it from popping out if the water level gets too high. We hope this answers your question.",
      "Dishwasher leaks towards end of cycle when rinsing from underneath ... coming out of where float switch is in the front left corner. \nwhat would need replaced?Hello Wendy, Thank you for contacting us. I suggest checking the following parts: PS11743008 Hose Clamp, PS11746825 Door Gasket - gray, and PS11740613 Hose Clamp. Good luck with your repair!",
      "My dish washer is old but seldom used by the previous owner of my home, but i will check for continuity of the float switch. How far up the float shaft should the palnut be?Hello Rick, Thank you for the question. The nut normally sits at the bottom of the float shaft. Hope this helps!",
      "Per prior question.......when i pulled the impeller to inspect it i took out the filter, pump etc and cleaned them out. is there something else i missed?Hi Jack, \n\nThank you for contacting us. You could also check your drain hose as well. Other than that, it could be a problem with your drain pump or with the electronic control board. Good luck with your repair."

      "My dishwasher the start button is not working but machine it is working sometimes by self without any touch.Hello Sharon, Thank you for your inquiry. We have researched the model number that you have provided and it could be an issue with the control panel or the control board. The easiest way to test is to disconnect the power from the dishwasher, open up the door panels, and unplug the control panel cable from the control board. Leaving the door open and the cable unplugged, reassemble the door, then turn the power to the dishwasher back on. Wait 10 minutes and then close the dishwasher door. If the issue is with the control panel, the control board will recognize the control panel is unplugged and turn the drain pump on, and the control panel touchpad is at fault. If it doesn't, then the issue is with the control board. We hope this helps and if you need help placing an order for a part, customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you!",

      "I’m having an intermittent draining problem with my dishwasher (e.25). The drain pump and impeller are clear and the motor spins freely. If i play with this drain cover it appears i can get the unit to drain. It also appears that if i remove this cover my unit will not drain. Is there a sensor that checks for this cover being in place? Could my issue be that sensor? Is this the turbidity sensor? Or is the all co-incidence and my controller unit is to blame. Draining fails often but i can always play with these parts in the sump to get it working flawlessly for a while. Frustrating. Thanks for any advice you have.Hello Steve, thank you for inquiring. You will want to consider the Drain Pump itself, part PS8727352, this Lid part PS8727344, or possibly the Drain Hose part PS8732952. There doesn't appear to be a sensor involved. We hope this helps.",
      "The user manual calls what you call a \"lid\" a \"cover\". I think that i ordered it correctly. I ordered the lid. It is very difficult to re-install and the dishwasher will not run unless it is properly installed. Is the lid the same as the cover that covers the drain pump impellers?Hi Ray, thank you for your question. This part is actually pretty easy to remove. It is locked into place by a locking tab. All you have to do is take a flat head screw driver and pry it at the short tail that comes up the side of the filter housing. Once you have unclipped it from the locking tab all you have to do is lift the part out of place. This part slips down into your filter housing area there. So once you get it into place you would just push it into place and into the tab. Good luck with your repair."

But I don't hear any water moving around to clean or rinse dishes.And dishes are not cleanHi Hollie,\n\nThank you for the question, Sounds like you need to replace the Circulation Pump Impeller Kit. This pump is what sends the water to the spray arms to wash the dishes. If the water is not circulating during the wash cycle then the Circulation Pump may need to be replaced. \n\nHope this helps!",
      "My dishwasher is not draining the bottom is holding water. The pump has been replaced but it's still not draining.Hello Luigi, thank you for inquiring. For this symptom you will want to replace either the Check Valve Flapper part PS258167, the Drain Pump part PS260804, or the Impeller and Seal Kit part PS259598. We hope this helps.",
      "My dishwasher is not draining the bottom is holding water. What is the likely causes?Hi Cliff,\nThank you for your inquiry.  There are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the check valve flapper, the drain pump, the sump filter and housing, the sump, the circulation pump and impeller kit and the drain tub.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "My dw is not getting the dishes clean and the detergent looks like it did when I put it in. Suggestions? Can I use anything to clean these parts instead of replacing? If so, what parts and what to use?Hi Joseph, Thank you for the question. It sounds like the water is not spraying or circulating within the appliance. First I suggest the spray arms You will need to remove them to see inside to see if there is anything built up and blocking the water from flowing through. If they are clear, you may need to replace the circulation pump, PartSelect Number PS3511326. Hope this helps!",
      "Hello, my dishwasher is not draining. If i disconnect the drainage hose, it drains immediately, which to me would suggest the issue is the pump, not a blockage or flapper valve. Am i on the right track? Could it also be the sump?Hi Sterling, thank you for your question. It does sound like it would be the pump that is the issue. However if it is the sump, you could actually inspect that part to see if there are any blockages in it. From what you mentioned you did not see any, but if you wanted to take another look that would not hurt. The sump is more of like a physical housing part that helps direct water and holds other electrical parts. So if there is something wrong with it, that would be something that you could see physically. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "I replaced the module rinse and cap assembly. The soap pod still sits undissolved at the end of the cycle.What part needs attention or replaced?Hello John, thank you for your question. If just the rinse aid cap was replaced, that would not fix the issue of the soap dispenser not opening. The whole dispenser assembly should be replaced, part number WD12X10163. If that was replaced and the issue is still happening the issue would be with the control board itself, part number PS783633. Unfortunately, that board has been discontinued by the manufacturer. Good luck with your repair!",
      "Comment nettoyer le filtre? il est inaccessible.Bonjour Annie, Merci pour la question. Vous devrez retirer le bras gicleur inférieur pour accéder au filtre.

      "What does the fine filter part do? Does this hold food particles? If so can it be cleaned or has to be replaced?Hi Ruth, thank you for reaching out. The fine filter, part number PS958919, is used to remove food particles and debris from the water to prevent the drain from clogging. It can be cleaned. We hope this information helps!",
      "My dishwasher is leaking. I was hoping to fix it myself before calling someone.\nBefore it started leaking, I also noticed it wasn't cleaning the dishes very well.Hello Denise, thank you for the query. According to our research, we would recommend checking the water inlet valve, part number PS3654179, to fix the issue. We hope this helps!",
      "Every few months i have to take off the two spray arms and clean out spray jets that get plugged with food particles.  Is there a filter that should prevent food particles from getting back into the spray cycle?Hello Dennis, thank you for your question. Model PDW8680N00SS, has two filters at the bottom of the dishwasher that should be cleaned each time the dishwasher is used. There is a large filter screen that catches large food particles, part number PS959277 and a smaller filter screen that catches fine particles, part number PS958919. We hope this helps."

Could you please verify the number you provided us with? If it is correct, I recommend contacting the manufacturer and seeing if they could provide you with a part number. However, we only ship our parts throughout the continental US and Canada.

No error codes or nothing, just finishes with the clean message and no sanitize message on the panel. Actually if dishes are to dirty, at the end some ones don't get well clean. I know that in order to accomplish the tasks mentioned above, the water has to be hotter than the one that is supply and the part in charge of maintain the water hot and make i t hotter, is the heater. I disassembled the heater and checked for continuity with a multimeter and it looks ok, multimeter beeps as long as i touch both ends on the place the cables connectors go. Searching the web i founded that the sensor as you also mention is not only in charge of measures level of soil in the water but it has a thermistor that is used to regulate water temperature. I supposed that this is maybe the problem, could it'll be?Hi Paul, thank you for your question. It could be either of those parts. The best thing to do would be to test them for continuity to see if they are working. Other things that you could check would be your tubes and spray arms for being clogged with debris.

Unfortunately, the gasket that goes inside the adapter on the hoses is not sold separately. The fill/drain hose assembly, which is PartSelect Number PS11749861, would have to be replaced.

      "I just got a GE pot scrubber portable dishwasher. Dont see a model number on it anywhere, but how do i connect it to faucet?Hello Scott, thank you for your question. Here are some instructions we have found for you! \n\nLoosen the aerator from the spout of the kitchen sink. Use a pair of pliers if necessary. Unscrew the aerator and store it in a safe place for future use.\n\nScrew the special faucet adapter that was included with your portable dishwasher onto the threaded faucet spout. Turn on the hot water at the kitchen faucet, and allow the water to run until it is hot to the touch. Turn the water faucet off.\n\nRoll the dishwasher over next to the sink. Pull the hoses from their storage compartment on the back of the dishwasher. Position the collar on the end of the hoses directly beneath the adapter on the kitchen faucet spout. Push the collar ring downward, and slide the collar onto the faucet adapter before releasing the collar ring. The collar should be securely attached to the faucet. Turn the hot water to the faucet back on.\n\nPlug in the dishwasher's electrical cord to a nearby AC outlet.\n\nLoad the dishwasher, select the desired wash cycle, and start the dishwasher.\n\nI hope this helps!",

      "Will not power on,I checked noise filter seems fine! 120v going in 120v coming outHi Douglas,\n\nThank you for the question. The locker switch assembly may be defective. The locker switch assembly is a part for your washing machine and tells the washer that the door is closed and locked into place. If the switch has shorted out and not locking, it is no longer delivering the message to the machine and it will not latch into place. If you find that your door will not close, open, or start, it is more than likely an issue with the locker switch assembly. The switch is located behind the front panel. You will need to remove the gasket to reach the switch.\n\nHope this helps!",
      "Dishwasher has three light bar on screen but won't start its an LGHello Devon, Thank you for the question. I suggest testing the switches on the door lock, PartSelect Number PS5574492.

      "The dishes are not drying and the \"sanitize\" light is blinking at the end of the cycle. The dishes are wet.  I have tested the heater element and I have some resistance at ~14 ohms. The thermostat shows continuity at room temperature; however, I am not sure at what temperature it should go to infinite? If those two items are fine then would it be with the control board?Hello Harry,\n\nThanks for your question. The electronic control board is PS8260225 - this is rarely the issue, but it could be worth cutting off power to the dishwasher for one minute and then restarting it to see if that fixes the issue before replacing the board. The heating element should read between 8 and 30 ohms so that is testing properly. High limit thermostats are open at room temperature. If cutting the power does not work, you may need to replace the board.\n\nI hope this helps.",
      "This dishwasher was approximately 18 months old when it stopped drying the dishes properly. The dishes are always wet on completion of the washing cycle - no heat drying ability.  I've tested the heating element and it rings out closed or @ 0.0 ohms. I've also tested the thermostat in the same manor - again it rang out closed or @ 0.0 ohms. The heating element to me is ok with the continuity test - not open or damaged. The t-stat on the other hand shouldn't be ringing out @ 0.0 ohms and should have some resistance...  am i on the right track? or are both parts sounding faulty?Hi Mike,\nThank you for your question.  If the heating element is reading fine, then I would replace the theromstat.   I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "My dishwasher wont start, i checked the breaker and the gfi and they are both workingHi Carmelo,\nThank you for your question.  If your dishwasher will not start, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which ones are causing the issue.  You will need to check the door balance link kit, the turbidity sensor, the door latch, the overfill control switch and the thermostat. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "The dishwasher is getting as hot as it normally does. During the wash cycle, the water is warm but not as hot. Also during the drying cycle, it’s not getting hot enough to dry the dishes. The heating element is brand new. We are wondering if the thermostat needs to be replaced.Hello, Thank you for your question. The parts that solve that issue is the Element and the thermostat. If the element is new and working properly it could be Thermostat- PartSelect Number PS11750035. We hope this helps.",
      "My dishwasher quit during the dry cycle.  I opened it and it was very hot and steamy, pressed start and it completed the cycle.  This was after previously having problems and checking the heater which measured 16 ohms, and replacing the thermostat.  After replacing the thermostat, i ran it through a diagnostic cycle which it completed fine, then ran it through a normal wash cycle with prodry selected (empty) and it completed fine.  So we loaded it with dishes and ran a normal was cycle with prodry and it stopped during the cycle.  Could the heater have a sporadic problem?  Should i replace it even though it measures as good, or, is there another more likely part to check/replace?Hi Jim, thank you for your question. If your heater is measuring working then you would not need to change it. I would suggest taking a look at the turbidity sensor perhaps. However the problem might actually be in your control board itself if it is not in the smaller parts like the thermostat and the sensor. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "We have moisture on the door when we open after cycle has completed! This also caused silverware to have moisture on it! In checking we opened door during drying cycle and it appears to be heating properly! Any suggestions!Hello Ken, Thank you for the email. I suggest checking to see if the door seal has wear and needs to be replaced. Also make sure the door is closing securely and is not lose allowing moisture and heat out during the drying cycle. Hope this helps!",
      "My dishes aren't drying properly. I replaced the heating element and the thermostat. Is there something I'm missing? What should I try next?\nThanks,\nPeteHi Pete,\nThank you for your question.  If your dishwasher is not drying the dishes and you have replaced the heating element and the thermostat, check the rinse aid on the detergent dispenser.  The rinse aid or the rinse aid dispensing door could be the reason why your dishwasher is not fully drying your dishes.  Without the rinse aid, the dishes will not shed water easily and they will not dry properly.  Your rinse aid dispenser will be found on the inside of the door, open the rinse aide door on the dispenser.   After verifying that there is rinse aid in the chamber, inspect the door and chamber for any signs of discoloration, warping, or any other damage.  If you find any issues with your rinse aid dispenser door while performing this inspection, you will need to replace the detergent dispenser.  The part number listed under your model number for the detergent dispenser is PS11731570.  If you need to place an order for it, customer service is open 7 days a week and anyone will be happy to assist you.  Please feel free to give us a call.  We look forward to hearing from you!",
      "My dishwasher occasionally keeps washing dishes and never stops until we open the door and manually set it to drain.  We think it might only do this when we use the normal wash cycle, bunt we haven’t experienced it on express wash.  We think it is just an ever ending wash cycle,and never drains.  Water gets hot, everything else seems to work.  Thanks for any advice.Hello Jeremy, thank you for your question. We would recommend testing/replacing the thermostat and the turbidity sensor. If the sensor is bad, it will continue to detect dirty water and keep washing. I hope this helps.",
      "Our dishwasher won't complete it's cycles.  If i just start it, it will fill with water then just blink the front light - not run.  If i run the water at the faucet until it is really hot, it will complete the first cycle, but, then it may not run the rinse cycle.  If it completes that, it begins blinking during the dry cycle.I assume the problem is with the heater or the thermostat.  is there a way to determine which without removing the parts and testing? are there any other parts that could be at fault?Hello Jim, Thank you for the question. Unfortunately the only way to know for sure if they are defective is to remove and test them. If the element and thermostat is good, you may need to replace the main control board. Hope this helps, good luck with this repair!",
      "Following up on my prior question - i measured the resistance of the heating element - it was 12 ohms which seems to be an acceptable range from the other messages.  I then measured the resistance of the thermostat (assuming it is the part on the spring bracket near the front of the dishwasher near the water inlet) and it was zero at room temperature.  You'd commented previously that this connection was normally open at room temperature, so, is it good or bad?  If bad - can you tell me how to remove it?If good do you have other suggestions of what i can check to find out what is wrong with our dishwasher?Hello Jim, Thank you for the question. If there is no reading at all then it sounds like it can be defective. The thermostat just plugs into place.  Hope this helps, good luck with this repair!"

There was a plastic seal ring that had a split in it.  I didn't know if the split was supposed to be in it, but my brother in law stapled it top and bottom to close the gap.  That did not help.  Water still coming from bottom of door.  The long gasket that goes around door opening, top and sides appears to be okay.  Is there a bottom door seal that i can't see that would cause this problem?  Please help!Hello Beverly,\nThank you for your question. The seal that goes on the spray arm, is supposed to be split. It is not a defect, the manufacturer purposely makes it that way. There is not a specific bottom dear seal piece for your model 66515732000. If you have checked your door gasket and lower spray arm seal, we would recommend checking your Wash Arm Bearing ring under part number PS11747064. That is another type of seal on the spray arm that can cause your leak as well. We hope this helps you."

      "My upper wheel rack of my dishwasher simply wore out, obviously it got too hot and brittle over the years and I need it replaced. I purchased this part because in the picture it showed both upper and lower wheels on the bracket, but subsequently reading reviews it may only come with the upper wheel and the lower needs to be purchased separately? Is this true? If it only comes with one wheel (upper) and I need to buy lower separately, then this is very misleading; if it comes with both, then a reasonable price, but a little high!! If it does not come with the lower wheel, then I need that part number only as this is the part that’s failed and I’ll send back the more expensive part just to replace the lower cost lower wheel only. LMK.Hello Andrew, Thank you for the question. This is sold as the individual Upper Rack Roller as seen in the picture. It is the bracket with the two rollers that attach to the bracket.

      "Dishwasher no heating, once dishwasher completes you open the door and temp is only lukewarm. Replaced the heating element two days ago and no change. We cant remember the last time it worked properly. Dishwasher leaves a soap film on front door and does not dry dishes. I assume i need a thermostat, but can not find it for this model.Please help.Hello Matthew, thank you for your question. There would be a few things to check before ordering any parts. I would check to make sure the heating element received is working properly, by checking continuity. Depending upon the manufacturer, the element should read 15 to 25 ohms of resistance. If it reads \"0\", then it's bad. It is possible the part was defective. If the part is testing good, I would check to see what the temperature of the water is that is coming from the house to the unit. The temperature might need to be adjusted. Also, it is recommended that you \"prime\" the unit by running the water at the sink in your kitchen until the water is hot. Then turn on the dishwasher. If the water source takes a while to heat, the water going into the unit might not be hot enough for the element to keep hot. I hope this helps!",
      "You just answered my last question but need a followup: 1. I failed to mention that it doesn't heat during the drying phase, i would expect it to heat and dry the dishes. That is why we ordered the heating element to replace. 2. How do i adjust the temp coming into the dishwasher? Thank youHello Matthew, Thank you for your inquiry. Water entering the dishwasher must be at least 120 degrees Fahrenheit and not more than 150 degrees Fahrenheit for the best cleaning/drying and to prevent damage to the dishes. You have to adjust the temperature at the point where the fill hoses are attached to the sink or where the water enters and goes into the water inlet valve-check your water heater as well. Also make sure you are using plenty of rinse aid to assist in drying. If the element tests ok with a multimeter, you may have an issue with your control board as well. Hope this helps!",
      "My dishwasher drains the water but at the end of the cycle there is still an abnormal amount of water in the bottom. I’ve already replaced the level sensor and water inlet valve because of other problems.Hi Brandon,\nThank you for your question.  It is normal at the end of a cycle to have 1 or 2 cups of water left in the bottom of the dishwasher.  If there is more than 1 or 2 cups of water left in the dishwasher, there may be debris trapped in the pump preventing the water from draining completely.  You will need to inspect the pump to see if this is what is causing the issue and clean it if it is.  If the pump is not the issue, you may have to replace the flood switch.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "Do you have a procedure for testing a wd21x10494 GE turbidity sensor?Hello Dan, thank you for your question. With the power supply to the dishwasher turned off, the turbidity sensor can be tested from the main control at the connection P12 from the wire at pin 1 to the wire at pin 3. The resistance should measure between 46KO to 52KO at room temperature. We hope this helps.",
      "Hi, you have answered two of my questions. All of this makes sense and I will be checking the timer and the element. The temperatures do not really make sense to me as my dishes look clean even after drying (with air/open dishwasher). My issue is once the dishwasher stops running, I open the door and it is not hot in the washer which makes me think the element is not heating. Can you point me to if I need to change the control board if it turns out my element is good? You do not think it is the thermostat? I want to be mindful of my cost in parts to justify not purchasing a new washer.Hello Matthew,\n\nThanks for your question. It is also possible the vent might not be opening properly. Check to see if it is opening or if the vent is damaged. If that is not the issue, then it could be an issue with your dispenser. First, make sure the rinse aid chamber is not empty. If there is rinse aid in the chamber, then inspect the cap to make sure it is properly fitted and adjusted properly.\n\nI hope this helps.",
      "I’m having problems with my dishwasher not heating during the drying phase and the soap is not rinsing off the dishes. I’ve already replaced the heating element and i’m not sure if it is draining like it should. There is still some water remaining when i unscrew the filter. About two weeks ago there was a grinding noise like something we put in the dishwasher may have broke and got caught in the grinder. There were some small black plastic pieces in the filter and they have all been removed. I’m trying to figure out what to check and what parts i need.Hi Joe,\nThank you for your question.  If your dishwasher is not cleaning properly, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the spray arms, the docking station (if present), the upper discharge housing gasket (if present), the chopper, the water inlet valve, the water delivery tube, the filters, the wash spinner, the detergent spinner, the pump impellers and the pump.  All dishwashers will have a method to drain the water. Most models will have a single motor driven pump with two separate compartments, one for circulation and one for drain, each with its own impeller. Other types will have a separate drain pump and some will utilize the main circulating pump in conjunction with a drain solenoid and diverter valve or flapper. On models that use a separate drain pump you should check to see if there is any obstruction to the input and output of the pump and also verify that there is power getting to the pump motor during the drain portion of the cycle. If both check ok, then you should replace the pump and motor assembly.\n\nOn models that use a drain flapper and solenoid, again you should check for any obstructions and verify that the solenoid is getting energized and that there is continuity. Use a multi-meter to make these tests. Check that the linkage operating the flapper or diverter is moving freely and replace any defective parts. On models that have a two section pump, the drain impeller may be at fault. First, verify that the motor is running in the proper direction. If the motor does not run, then check for power at the terminals on the motor. If voltage is not present, then you should check door switches, timer or electronic control as a possible cause. If proper voltage is present, then the motor windings could be open. If the motor is humming, then the problem could be that the drain impeller is jammed or the motor could be seized. If the motor is seized, then the motor or motor and pump assembly will need to be replaced. The electrical checks can be made with a multi-meter.\n\nDisassembly of the pump will be required to determine if the impeller is the problem. The drain compartment is typically located beneath the circulating compartment. Remove the lower rack, spray arm, pump cover and filter assembly to gain access. Inspect the drain impeller for damage or wear and replace if required. Also check that the food chopper is in good condition and not allowing large food particles to clog the drain outlet, and that both the chopper and impeller are turning freely.  Also if the soap is not dissolving, the water may not be hot enough.  Before starting a cycle on the dishwasher, turn the hot water tap on and let it run for a few minutes and then start the cycle.  You may have to vary the amount of soap you use as well.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "DH looks like stop cycling and doesn't drain. If I press to drain it does so I think is not the drain pump. I replaced the flood switch and the board and still does the same.Hi Yunior, thank you for contacting us. Based on our understanding of the issue, we would suggest checking the drain pump, part number PS16219695, for continuity. We hope this solves your problem!",
      "Bottom water dispenser melted twice. I tripped the door switch and watched the dispenser move freely with water running. Checked the bottom rack for obstructions. None found. What could cause this to melt.Hello Robert, thank you for your inquiry. Based on our research, the wash arm melts when it is typically not secured into the pump properly. In such case, it rotates and then gets stuck on the heating element bracket. We would recommend replacing the lower spray arm, part number PS16542476, and installing it properly. We hope this helps.",

I guess my question is, how does the diverter valve work? if the rotation of the circulation pump flows one way, then how does the ball on the diverter valve know which direction to go? Please let me know your thoughts. \n\nThank youHi Dustin, thank you for reaching out. Based on our research, the diverter motor moves the diverter disc or ball into position so the ball can direct water through the upper and mid spray arms. We suggest that you take a closer look at the diverter assembly kit, part number PS7783379, to solve the issue. We hope this helps!"

It is possible that the missing cap is in some way responsible, especially if this issue started following the cap falling off. However, first I would suggest checking PS8260087 Heating Element, and PS11743423 High Limit Thermostat with a multimeter. Good luck with your repair!"

You can also open the door once the fill cycle is done and see if the water is over the element. If the water is above the element then the appliance is over filling. Hope this helps!",

      "How to uninstall the dishwasherHi Eloy,\nThank you for your question.  To remove the dishwasher from the cabinet, first unplug the appliance from the electrical outlet.  Also shut off the water supply valve.  Then remove the screws securing the lower access panel and set the panel aside.   Disconnect the water supply line from the inlet valve and be prepared for some water to spill out.  Remove the the screw securing the junction box cover.  Note the orientation of the wires on the terminal block and loosen the screws to release the wires.  Remove the screws securing the bracket.  Use a flat head screw driver to release the nut from the bracket, then disconnect the drain hose and feed it through the cabinet.  Once you have completed these steps, open the dishwasher door and release the mounting screws securing dishwasher to the cabinet. To remove the dishwasher, you may need to remove the levelling legs locking screws.  Once removed, you can pull the dishwasher from the cabinet.  We hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day.",

      "Hello, I have a Maytag dishwasher (silver color, model: Mdb8969sdm3, ser # f54911518, type # 577 1). I normally run it at auto cycle, heating, and it takes between 2 3 hrs to complete. Of late I have been noticing water droplet condensation towards upper left under kitchen counter top (above the door of the dish washer) during the cycle.These water droplets fall down and form a pool that is spoiling the hard wood flooring of the kitchen close to the kitchen cabinet adjacent to the dish washer. This dishwasher has no vents on the door top that could facilitate heat condensation to dissipate. I assume this could be a gasket problem, but there are two gaskets in the dishwasher,inner and outer one. The inner one probably seals the inner part (extended portion towards washer) of the door and the outer one probably seals the little outer part of the door. Please let me know if the above could be a possible reason.  This dishwasher is from previous home owners who retained it for us. It also displays 10 years limited parts warranty on the door. Looking forward to your help, thanks.Hi Kaiser, Thank you for the question. As far as the warranty goes you will need to contact Maytag. It will be best to inspect the gaskets to check for any wear or damage. The most likely cause is the gasket that attaches tot he door, PartSelect Number PS11722167. I also suggest checking to make sure the door is latched properly. If the latch is not holding the door closed it can cause the leak as well.Hope this helps!"

      "Is this part difficult to install?  When was this model manufactured?  Are there directions to install?Hello Tim, thank you for your question. This part is a very easy part to install. We have directions on our site, provided by other customers, that give steps on how they installed the part. There are also lots of installation videos online. Unfortunately, we do not have the date of manufacturing for your appliance. I hope this information helps!",
      "Is the mounting bracket for this water inlet valve available as a separate part? I have replaced the valve but still have a slight leak; I think the \"plate\" isn't fitting against the o-ring properly.Hello Don,\n\nThanks for your question. We show that the mounting bracket is only available with the entire water inlet valve assembly.\n\nI hope this helps.",
      "Will replacing the inlet valve stop the dishwasher from filling when it is not runningHello Liz, thank you for your inquiry. As the problem of the dishwasher filling when it is not running is mostly caused by a faulty water inlet valve, it is highly likely that replacing it would solve the problem. However, sometimes it is also caused by a damaged float switch part number PS260235 and dishwasher float part number PS259159, so you might also want to look into that. Please do not hesitate to ask any more questions that you might have. Customer service is available 7 days a week if you need help with purchasing."

      "Dishwasher does not not drain properly all the time, which make water leak from bottom of door. Could it be a  drain switch or timer?Hello Chris, thank you for getting in touch. We would recommend cleaning the filter and drain hose properly. If it does not resolve the issue, you may need to replace the drain check valve, part number PS382661, to fix the issue. The check valve prevents water from returning to the dishwasher after it has drained. If the valve gets stuck closed, it will prevent the water from draining. We hope this sorts out your problem!"

Not sure how to remove this part and reinstall after cleaning.Hello Susan, Thank you for your inquiry. Open up the dishwasher door. Pull the lower dishrack out and set it aside. Now you should have access to the sump cover right behind the lower spray arm.  There's two quarter inch screws that hold it in, use a nut driver to take them out. Reach in and take the cover off. Once you have cleaned the area, replace the cover and screws. Then slide the lower dishrack back in. Hope this helps!",

The Accumulation Filter is there to catch any food or dibris and prevents it from getting back onto the dishes so without dishes to worry about there should be no issues. \n\nThanks again for your great question!",

      "I have a Maytag 665.15114 dw. Apparently the wdt710paym4 Whirlpool is the same unit.  Neither spray arms work. I've cleaned them both. I've replaced the water control valve and circulation pump. It drains fine. To test water level i added a couple quarts of additional water after the filling process. I hear a series of clicks from the control panel. It appears to run through the cycles but never spray the water. Help please.Hello Dan, Thank you for your inquiry. I would check both of your spray arms to make sure they are not clogged. We would also check your impeller motor and pump assembly to make sure it is working properly to force the water up through the wash arms. You can also test the Turbidity Sensor with a multimeter to make sure it is functioning as well. Hope this helps!",
      "Water is not draining after wash cycle. It will drain if you push the drain cancel button, but it is starting to not drain unless you stop and start the drain cyle a few times. Would replacing the drain pump correct this or does something else control the drain pump?Hi Matt,\nThank you for your inquiry.  The drain pump is the part that fixes the issue the majority of the time.  There are some parts that you may need to check as well to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the drain hose, the filter, the turbidity sensor and the heating element.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",

      "Is this likely the best next step?   My dishwasher starts and fills, then the panel clicks which may or may not be followed by humming underneath the dishwasher.  It waits the appropriate time and then drains and continues.  What it doesn't do is spray water through the arms or dispense the detergent.   I checked that the arms aren't clogged, checked that the float moves freely, checked whether the inlet valve was clogged, ran a quart of vinegar through it which visibly cleaned some fat out of the drain hose, and checked the door switch with a multimeter and it is fine.  This looks like an easy job and i can actually reach it from the front of the machine, but should i be looking at anything else first? Thanks!Hello Karen,\nThank you for your question. After doing the checks with the spray arms and door switch, yes we would also suggest replacing the turbidity sensor under part PS11757214 for your model to fix the issues, as there aren't any other parts other then the control board as a last case scenario that would fix the issues.

      "Does ice maker comes with cycling thermostat and can i tell if ice maker is bad or thermostatHello Jeff, thank you for your question. Yes, the icemaker comes with the thermostat. This thermostat controls and regulates the ice maker ejection cycle by monitoring the temperature inside the freezer to determine when to release the ice into the bin and start the ice making cycle again. If your ice maker is making unusual noises, or if the ice maker is not making or dispensing ice, there could be an issue with the thermostat. You can test this thermostat with a multimeter to see if it has continuity. If the thermostat does not have continuity you would want to replace the thermostat itself. I hope this helps!",
      "The ice maker does not dispense ice.  Will this part resolve this problem?Thank you.Hello George, Thank you for the question. if the ice maker is still making ice then the ice Maker is fine. If the ice is not dispensing, you can try to remove the ice container and let it sit out to thaw any ice build up within the container. If this does not fix the issue you can take the bin apart and check for any damaged parts within the container. You should be able to hear the motor in the container when it is trying to dispense. If the motor is not turning on to dispense, you may have a defective Motor, Part Number: PS11740462. Hope this helps!",

The answer i received was regarding an ice maker not working which isn't my issue.  The problem is, it keeps making ice, the metal lever doesnt stay up which is supposed to stop it from making ice. Thanks.Hi Shari. If the arm won't stay up you can try replacing the shut off arm PS11750229. Thank you for your question and good luck with your repair.",
      "No ice. Water valve functional upon testing with 120v.....water flows......i re started fridge and am waiting for fill valve to energize.....anything i can look for.....would like to test the functions from the front but not sure if i need to......the bar moved when I restarted the equipment.Hi Ken, thank you for your question. In most cases, if both of the solenoids on your water inlet valve are testing within 500 - 1500 ohms of resistance, then the problem would be with the ice maker not calling up water to start making the ice. Which means that you may have to replace your ice maker itself if the issue is not in your water valve. Good luck with your repair.",
      "How do you adjust the ice cube size?Hello John, Thank you for the question. There is a small plastic screw at the front of the icemaker that would be an adjustment screw and you would simply turn it a 1/4 turn counter clockwise but no more than that. Hope this helps!",

      "Normal wash cycle light is flashing. I assume this is some kind of fault code, but I don’t have a clue what the fault is. Any help would be appreciated.\nThanksHello Charles, thank you for your inquiry. It means that the normal button is shorted or held for more than 17 seconds. Try to unplug the dishwasher and heat up the touchpad with a hair dryer. Then rub your thumb over the normal button to try to unstick it. Allow it to cool and then re-apply power. Now if it still acts up you will need to replace the control panel, part number PS11751093. Good luck with this repair!",

Part number PS11722974 for the black panel, part number PS11722976 for the white panel, and part number PS11722977 for the biscuit pannel. If the buttons are not working on them, it may be worth replacing the control panel.\n\nI hope this helps.",

      "I’m having problems with my dishwasher door. I recently replace the ropes and then I replaced the pulleys and yet the door is still flimsy and barely holding itself up. I need advice on how to move forwardHi Liam, based on your description you should check the springs on the door. It sounds like they are weak, which would cause the door to act that way. You should also check to see if the springs are in the right place on the base. Please let us know if you have any further questions!",
      "The door to my dishwasher just slam open.  No resistance when opening.  Not sure which part I should order.Hello Abby,  Thank you for contacting us.

      "When lowering the door, last night, i heard a popping sound...the sound you hear when a cord, or spring snaps.  now, when lowering the door it seems heavy....as though there is nothing to help hold it from flopping down.  my door is extra-heavy, as it has a wood panel. thanks for any guidance you can give me.Hello Susanna, Thank you for the question.

      "So one of the links broke on my dishwasher and I have to buy this kit to fix it. I know the kit comes with 2. So my question is do I have to replace both or can I just save one for a rainy day?Hi Simon, although you do not have to replace both sides together, we do recommend doing so. This is because it will create an even wear, and the unbroken one has potentially been weakened. Best of luck with this repair!",
      "My dishwasher is being the biggest pain!! I just recently had a repair man in here and I don’t want to do that again so i’m looking for help on how to fix it, or even just diagnose it. The door wont close properly and I think it has something to do with the alignment. Its not completely straight, and tbh looks a little lopsided. What should I doHello Jade, by the sounds of things your dishwasher door has been lifted off the hinge pin. To fix it you must lift the door, and see if you can pop it back on to the hinge pin. If you are not able to, you may need to pull the unit outwards to access the hinge assembly. If you cannot get the door back onto the hinge pin, you may need to replace the hinge assembly because it may be damaged. I hope this helps.",
      "I can't reattach the lower arm that sprays there isn't anything for it to clip onto. I have a Kenmore quiet guardHi Sarah,\n\nThank you for the question, I suggest maybe checking the diagrams for your model number to see if you are missing any parts. There should be a Spray Arm Nut, PartSelect Number PS420799. Then there should be a Base Filter Part Number PS3655066 and then the Filter Ring, Part Number PS420499. These parts should fit all together.\n\nHope this helps!",
      "What is the length of the cord on this part? I bought one from another place and it was too short.Hi Bob,\n\nThank you for your question. Unfortunately the manufacturer does not give us specifications on their parts. We have taken a picture of this part on a one inch grid background. Each half of the cord are approximately 12\". I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "The door will not stay closed. Has been working fine until today. Tried the troubleshooting turn off at the breaker. Cancelled out all the programs. Checked the racks for anything hold it. Still will not close. Dishwasher is a little over 1 year old. I can get it to close but it pops open again unless i hold it closed. If it has hopped off the pin, how do i fix it and does the fix require a lot of strength ?Hi Bonnie,\nThank you for your question.  If the door is not latching correctly, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the door balance link kit, the mounting brackets, the door springs, the adjuster clips, the door hinges, the door strike and the door latch.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "The top drawer of the dishwasher will not stay in. What do I need to do?Hi Thomas, Thank you for the question. If the rack is coming off the end of the rails when you pull it out you will need to check the rack stops. The stops fit in the end of the rails that attach to the inside wall of the dishwasher and prevent the rack from coming all the way out and off the rails. Hope this helps!",
      "The dishwasher door is extremely heavy  when lowering to put dishes in. What part would you suggest i need to fix the problem?Hi Deborah,\n\nThank you for your inquiry. The door balance link kit is the most likely cause for this, I would also suggest checking your hinges and checking your door springs as well. Good luck with your repair."

      "Have partially disassembled the Whirlpool dishwasher, and found the grinder assembly gear broken and a portion of the plastic gear on the circulation pump shaft broken.  Is it possible to get the plastic gear on the circulation pump or do i have to replace the whole motor?  I see on your website that i can get a new grinder assembly.Hi Charles, \n\nThank you for your question. You would have to replace your circulation pump. Unfortunately that part would not come separately from it. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Noisy machine how i do i figure which of the two pumps listed  to replace to eliminate the noise? I have a kitchen aid dishwasher model #kuds03ftss3Hi Brian,\nThank you for your question.  I would start with the circulation pump and motor as the majority of the time, this part causes the noise.  Use a multimeter to test each of the electronic parts to see which ones are causing the issue.  Once you know which part is causing the issue, you may contact us back and we can place an order for you.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "The tub fills & drains, the heating element works (steam on heated drying), but no water from any of the sprayers.  Wondering what the probability is that the circulation pump is the issue, before laying out $150 for a new one.  Are there any other component failures that might account for my issue?  I've already checked / cleaned all the components accessible form inside the washer.Hi Russ,\n\nThank you for the question. If all of the components are clean and the dishwasher is working and operating as normal it is suggested to replace the circulation pump. \n\nThank you for the question!",
      "My dishwasher works fine, but i just noticed it is now much louder than before.  The noise is coming from underneath and sounds like the pump motor.   The drain motor is quiet. Could there be something stuck in the pump motor assembly or do you think the bearing is going? The dishwasher is about 10 years old and a new motor is over $136.00, so i am wondering if the motor does need replacement, would it be worth it? And, if so, should i replace the entire sump and motor assembly below (which would be about $176.00)?  Thank you.Hello Allen, Thank you for your inquiry. I would try cleaning the pump first, and also check the chopper and seals to see if they are clogged. If the bearings in the circulation pump are wearing out, they will emit a droning noise. If that's the case, you would have to replace the circulation pump. Also check the water inlet valve as well. Hope this helps!",
      "Replaced the circulation pump/motor yet the middle and upper sprayers still are not operating. Have cleaned out the chopper and strainer and all of the sprayers. What are possible suspects?Hello Gerry, thank you for your question. I would recommend checking the Part #: PS11746720 manifold valve, and the mainfold Part #: PS11746590. These items are on the spray arm diagram, item # 11 and 12. There is a ball that moves inside the manifold valve to divert the water to the correct area, up the tube and to the spray arms. I hope this helps!",
      "When i turn dishwasher on it fills with water and then makes a very loud roaring sound and i just turn it off. Can u please tell me what might be causing this?Hello Dave, thank you for inquiring!  More than likely, it is the circulation pump and motor, as that is what pushes water through the spray arms and would run for most of the cycle.  We hope this helps and good luck with your repair!",
      "Dishwasher fills, heat works, lights on panel work, start button works, but it doesn't advance and i never hear the water moving.  I pressed \"cancel/drain\" and it works.  I never use the \"heat dry\" but when it stopped working, it smelled burning hot.   Did the motor burn out?Hi Ginny,\n\nThank you for the question. I will recommend starting with the fuse. You can test it with a multi meter to see if it is testing defective or some have ordered it to see if it fixed the issue. \n\nHope this helps !",
      "My dishwasher isn’t spraying water so i removed the circulation pump. The motor doesn’t turn by hand so i was wondering if it should be able to spin freely.Hi Josy, thank you for your question. It should not be able to spin freely. The motor would only move when it is activated. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Yes, have replaced drain pump #wpw10348269; sump pump check valve #wp8268375; and drain hose wpw10358302. I start any cycle and hear fill and run, but i do not hear it drain, and when i press drain button, i can hear it hummm, but it does not drainHello and thank you for writing.\nIf draining your dishwasher is an issue, here are 8 things you can try if you have not already done so before considering changing another part :\n\n1.  Run the Disposal \nFull disposal or an air gap in a connecting hose may prevent water from properly draining out of the machine.\n\n2. Check for Blockages \nCheck the bottom of the dishwasher to make sure that an item or piece of food hasn't fallen from the rack to block the water flow.\n\n3. Carefully Load the Dishwasher\nMake sure you’re loading the dishwasher correctly. Read the manufacturers’ instructions or owner’s manual for tips and directions on how to load dishes for the best results.\n\n4. Clean or Change the Filter\nYou may have a clogged filter. Many homeowners don’t realize that dishwasher filters need to be cleaned regularly. Check your owner’s manual to see where the filter is located on your dishwasher, and for instructions on how and when to clean it. For many dishwashers, the filter can be found on the inside bottom of the appliance.\n\n5. Inspect the Drain Hose\nCheck the drain hose connecting to the sink and garbage disposal. Straighten any kinks that you may see which could be causing the problem. Blow through the hose or poke a wire hanger through to check for clogs. Make sure the hose seal is tight.\n\n6. Double-Check the Drain Valve\nInspect the drain valve found on the valve bracket, often located at the bottom of the machine. Push on the valve to make sure it moves freely and isn’t frozen.\n\n7. Unclog or Clean the Drain Basket\nLook at the drain basket, usually found on the bottom of the side of the appliance, to see if it’s been clogged by food particles or detergent. Wash out the basket to clear any debris.\n\n8. Listen to Your Machine While it's Running\nListen to your machine while it’s running. If the machine doesn’t make the usual operating sounds, particularly if it’s making a humming or clicking noise, the motor PS11757388may needs replacing.\n We hope this information helps. Please contact us anytime if you require further assistance.",
      "My dishwasher stopped filling with water and runs dry and makes a lot of noise. I know water inlet valve is ok and water is reaching the washer. Is this the part i need or should i replace the sump assembly? It seems both are related to a dishwasher not pumping water through but i know only one of them is bad \nIf it helps i didnt notice anything gradual - just all of the sudden noticed noise and that dishes were not getting clean or wetHello Jake,\nThank you for your question. Our sources suggest the pump and motor over the sump assembly to fix the water issues. We hope this helps."

    "Product_Description": "\nDoor Catch Kit Specifications\nThis part replaces your appliances latch (Door Latch Kit, Door Catch, Dryer Door Latch Kit). On your appliance you will find both a strike and a catch. The strike is mounted on the body of the dryer, while the catch is mounted on the dryer door. These two parts work together to keep your dryer door closed. The catch holds the door strike to keep the door closed during the drying cycle. If the door does not latch closed, you won’t be able to start a drying cycle. If this part is malfunctioning, you may not be able to open or close your door. In some instances, it may seem like your door is closing, but if it is not latching properly you won’t be able to start your drying cycle. You should replace this part as soon as it’s malfunctioning. Your dryer may run even though the latch is malfunctioning, but it is unsafe if the dryer continues to run while the door is open. This replacement part features 1 door latch kit which includes 2 strikes, 3 catches, and a set of instructions. This model is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in white/silver.\n",

      "My latch kit did not come with instructions on which catch to use on my dryer, 025, 022, or 020? Please send the instructions that indicate which one to use as the video indicates.Hello Eric,\n\nThanks for your question. Number 020 is the yellow catch. Number 022 is the blue catch. Number 025 is the green catch. If the catch you are replacing has an 18 on it or if it is silver, use the 020 yellow catch. If nothing matches check if your dryer has one catch, and make sure it is not a 27\" Wide Laundry Center or a Commercial Stacked Pair and if that is true, use the 020 yellow catch. If it is either of those types of machines, use the 025 green catch. If your dryer has two catches, use the 022 blue catch on the top and the 020 yellow catch on the bottom.\n\nI hope this helps.",

Please let us know if you have any further questions!",
      "My dryer will not start when i push the start button.  I have already replaced the door switch, but that did not fix the problem.  Here is what's happening;  when i have the dryer set to start and close the door, the dryer makes a soft whirring/clicking sound.  When i push the start button, there is a loud click, the whirring stops, but the dryer does not start.  Do these symptoms give any indication of which part might be faulty?Hi Erin,\n\nThank you for your question. There are a couple of other parts that you would check to see if they are working correctly. The first part I would actually suggest testing is your start switch. You may also want to test your thermal fuse as well. You can test both parts with a multi meter to see what the continuity is on them. If both of those parts are fine you might go on to test your thermostats and your element as well. If those parts are fine then it may be your timer that is the issue. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "I have to slam the door to stay shut or it pops out and the drying cycle stops. When I took the door apart there was a loose spring rolling around inside the door.

I will order the latch anyway but I am wondering if anything else could be wrong? In addition, the light burned out. Does it require the exact replacement bulb?Hello Gerald,\n\nThanks for your question. The door catch kit would be the most likely solution for your problem based on your description. As for the bulb, we are only showing one bulb that is compatible with your machine based on the manufacturer's part list.\n\nI hope this helps.",

Which catch part does that correspond to?Hi Morgan, thank you for your question. These would be the instructions from the manufacturer: This kit contains (2) door strikes and various door catches. Some dryers may use more than (1) catch. Note numbers stamped on the catches and/or color of the spring steel, 20 (yellow), 22 (blue) or 25 (green). Match the number and/or color, of the catch being replaced with the catch supplied in the kit. If the catch you’re replacing has an 18 stamped on it or is silver in color, use the catch stamped with 20 (yellow) for replacement. The (2) door strikes contained in the kit are the same. Please replace the door strike(s) with the appropriate number of door catches being used for this repair. If you cannot match the number on the catches, match the catch(es) by the following: 1. If your dryer has one catch and is not a 27” Wide Laundry Center or Commercial Stacked Pair, use the catch stamped with 20 (yellow) for replacement. If it is a 27” Laundry Center or Commercial Stacked Pair, use the catch stamped with 25 (green) for replacement. 2. If your dryer has 2 catches, use the catch stamped with 22 (blue) on the top and the catch stamped 20 (yellow) on the bottom.  I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",

      "How do you install this part?Hi Andrea,\n\nThank you for your question. First unplug your appliance. Then unscrew the knob from underneath the latch. You will open your door and remove the screws around the door to separate the inner and outer door panels. The two screws at the bottom of your door are different so make sure to remember which one goes where. Lift your door back into a closed position but not entirely closing the door. Gently pull down the front panel of your door. Now open the latch half way and then press on the release on the back of the part to remove the old latch assembly from your door. Then reverse this process to put your machine back together. Good luck with your repair.",

The dishwasher will keep running if you move the latch to temporally stop the cycle to put in another item to be washedHello Bill, Thank you for your inquiry. We have researched the model you have provided and we would recommend checking the following parts to fix your issue: the door latch kit, the interlock switch, the timer, and the push button switch kit. You can test the parts with a multimeter. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, we have videos available to assist you. We also recommend checking the wiring for any visible damage. We hope this helps."

      "the rinse aid fill does not empty the level is always fullHello John, thank you for your question. Hard water or detergent buildup may be clogging the dispenser, or the dispenser itself is bad. The rinse aid dispenser can be cleaned by using a turkey baster to suck out the dispenser tank. Then remove the cap of the dispenser and run a full hot cycle. This should clear any clogs. If this does not work, we recommend replacing the rinse aid dispenser. Part number PS11754648. We hope this helps.",

Of this year i replaced the rinse dispenser as it just didn't seem like it was working and now again it seems the silverware is getting spotted - what could be the problem as the rest of the machine works greatHello Ellen, thank you for your question. We would recommend checking the spray arms to see if the holes are clogged with any debris. You may also want to check the Accumulator and Filter\nPartSelect Number: PS897295 and Turbidity Sensor PartSelect Number: PS11757214. These parts help keep the water clean so the dishes come out clean. Also be sure the rinse aid is kept full. I hope this helps!",

Thank you for your question in regards to your unit (Model Number ADB1400AGW1). If it is attached to the door itself then based on our research, you likely will need to replace the Inner Door (PartSelect Number PS12074066). You can order this part either online at our website www.PartSelect.com or by calling us by phone at 888-260-4310. Best Regards."

      "fault:  the dishwasher is not cleaning the dishes.  i believe that the middle rack \"manifold\" has a sealing gasket (that has fallen off my dishwasher and may have been accidentally thrown away) that seals with the vertical water distribution.  please see the 2 pictures with the red circle in the dropbox url below.  based on the photo, can you tell if a sealing piece has fallen off my \"manifold\"?   \n\nafter some basic troubleshooting and using a waterproof video camera, i noticed that the bottom and top spray arms turn normally.  however, the \"middle spray arm\" does not turn.  i was able to confirm that there is good water pressure arriving to where the \"middle spray arm\" snaps on to the \"manifold.\"  i suspect that the problem is with the manifold part number ps11728085 and/or \"middle spray arm\" part number ps11755664.  i have uploaded 2 photos and a 30 second video to the following url that shows the parts in reference:  the video shows the inside of the dishwasher with the \"middle spray arm\" removed and the lower dish rack covered with a towel for video recording purposes.  you will notice good water pressure arriving to the where the \"middle spray arm\" is usually located but has been removed in this video for demonstration purposes.Hi Jim,\n\nThank you for contacting. Unfortunately we cannot view your video link. It will not open for us. However it sounds like it may just be that you have something clogged inside of your spray arm and that part will need to be replaced. There is a flap on your manifold just before the spray arm, if you believe that flap is what is causing the water not to get to your spray arm, then you would have to replace your manifold to fix that as the little gasket that will close off the adjustable heights on your manifold is only sold with the entire manifold. So there are really only two parts that it could be for you, your spray arm itself or your manifold. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

The door spring applies tension to the dishwasher door so that the door does not drop too quickly when it is opening. If the door drops too quickly, it could cause damage to the dishwasher door or dishwasher door hinges. This spring is sold individually. Check the spring on the opposite side of the dishwasher door, they often wear at the same rate so you may want to replace both springs for exact tension on either side. No tools are required for this repair. This is an OEM replacement part.\n",

      "I replaced the detergent dispenser, and the door still will not open to release detergent with the new dispenser in place. What else could be my problem? Appreciate any help.Hi Larry, \nThank you for your inquiry.  There a couple of reasons why your detergent dispenser may not be dispensing correctly.  The rinse aid cap may be lose and just needs to be tightened or it may be warped if it was damaged from the heat of the water in the dishwasher.  You will need to remove the cap to inspect it.  Also, the spring and hinge pin on the dispenser door could be the problem. The dispenser door is spring loaded, and is held in the closed position by a catch. Check that the spring and pin are not bent or broken and replace if required. If the catch is not releasing the door, then you should inspect the timer, the bi-metal release or the wax motor. I hope this helps with your repair.  Thank you and have a great day!",

The dishrack rollers are small wheels located on the sides of the dishrack and allow it to slide in and out effortlessly. Meanwhile, the dishrack adjuster is used to adjust the height via the selector at the back of this component. Over time, the rollers wear out. You may experience resistance or difficulty when sliding the dishrack in or out. If left unreplaced, your rollers or adjuster may break, causing dishes to tilt, collide, or fall over during the wash cycle. When removing a roller and adjuster from your appliance, you will need to pull out the dishrack partway. Detach the assembly by depressing the tabs on the two end stops before lifting them up. Keep in mind that the roller and adjuster are sold together, but the dishrack itself is sold separately.\n",

The tine row clip is adjustable, and it fits onto your dishrack to holds the tines into place. If your dishrack tine rows will not stay in position, you could have one or more broken tine clips. To replace a tine row clip, simply snap the old tine row clip out, and replace it with the new clip. This part is made of gray plastic and is approximately one inch long and half an inch wide. This part is sold individually, so it is a good idea to check all of your tine row clips to determine if more than one are broken.\n",

      "The washing machine has no water pressure. The water lines to the machine have proper pressure and there is power to the machine. Is there a pump that increases the water pressure or is that from the street? Thank YouHello Chris, Thank you for the question. This could be an indication the Water Valve is faulty and may need to be tested or replaced. Use your multitester to test the valve for continuity. Set the device to the ohms setting x 1. Touch each of the meter's probes to a terminal. If you receive a reading of infinity, it means the valve's solenoid is faulty and the valve needs to be replaced. If your valve has two solenoids (four terminals), test the second pair of terminals in the same manner. If either pair of terminals receives a result of infinity, replace the water inlet valve. We hope this helps!",

The solenoid is working as it is supposed to, and the pressure of the water draining through the disposal port is good. Am I looking at a timer issue?Hi Kevin, thank you for reaching out. According to our research, a little water left over after a cycle is normal. It is there to keep the seals from drying up and your dishwasher will pump it out immediately before you get started on a new load. However, if there is more water, we recommend checking the pump filter coupler, part number PS1517648, filter fine assembly, part number PS3511267, and the lower spray arm base, part number PS1765974.

Check the wiring between the motor assembly and the control panel. If this does not help, you may need to check the drain solenoid kit, part number PS1481923. It opens the drain valve flapper to drain the dishwasher. We hope this information is useful!"

      "Some time ago a small, soft, silicone plug from a coffee mug lid came out of the lid during washing and is stuck in the sump/pump of the dishwasher.  The pump works fine and drains the washer without a problem, but the stray plug can be heard \"spluttering\" around in the sump while it's draining.  I've had the top of the sump out of the washer but was not comfortable disassembling the assembly composed of the parts listed (m110, m025, m130, m035, m120).  Two questions:  1) can this assembly be carefully taken apart without causing damage; and 2) will i need to replace the gasket m035?  Thanks!Hello Don, thank you for your question. Yes, the sump can be taken apart, very carefully of course. We recommend taking pictures of the different steps you take to disassemble it so that it can be put back together with ease. The gasket should be replaced after its taken apart as reusing the old gasket can cause leaks! I hope this helps!",
      "After the dishwaher finihes the complete cycle and drains the system, a small amount of water remains the area under the rotor and sometimes is slightly discolored,  I suspect that the pump/impeller may be bad. Yes?Hello Jim, Thank you for your inquiry. First check the drain pump filter, check valve and drain hoses for any visible damage or clogs. We also recommend testing the drain pump case assembly with a multimeter. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, we have videos available to assist you. Good luck with your repair.",
      "In your reply you recommend using a multi meter. I am familiar with them but exactly what elements am I to test with it and what reading should I get when using it?Hi James, thank you for reaching out. You may test the heating element of your dishwasher. To check it you may follow the instructions below: \nLocate the heating element of the dishwasher. Open the dishwasher door and look into the tub. It is the thin, circular tube at the base of your dishwasher. It may or may not be covered. If it is covered, remove the lower dishrack, and then remove the cover. Your heating element is going to have two metal terminals. One at each end. Each terminal reaches downwards, into the base of the dishwasher. Pinpoint the area where the heating element terminals extend through the base of the dishwasher. They will each have a wire connected to it. Grasp the connector and pull on it firmly. Use your multimeter to test the heating element for continuity. Set the device to the ohms setting x 1. Touch each meter probe to a terminal. You should receive a reading somewhere between infinity and zero. However, if the test you conduct produces a reading of infinite resistance (meter needle does not move), then that is indicative of a faulty heating element, and you should replace yours. Similarly, if the test you conduct produces a reading of zero resistance (meter needle moves to the other extreme of the scale), then that is also indicative of a faulty heating element, and you may replace it.

It’s leaking under the black rubber coating on the bottom of the dishwasher by the pump/motor assembly but i can’t find any water around it…but it’s dripping water on the very back of coming from the black rubber coating no water anywhere else on the dishwasher. I checked the bottom sprayer, filter, took it apart checked the impeller, and the inlet and outlet water openings In the assembly and they are not plugged…but I can’t get the impeller off to check around the heating element. So idk if I need a whole new assembly or what…but water isn’t leaking around it anywhere just behind it under the rubber coating…I’m baffledHello Desmond, Thank you for your inquiry. Researching the model number that you have provided, it could be an issue with the impeller, but it could also be a crack in the sump housing or with the drain case assembly. Although we do not have instructions for this specific part number, we have included a link to a repair video for a similar part to give you a general idea of the repair. You should also be able to lift the sump housing underneath out and check for any cracks. Good luck with your repair."

It's not making any unusual noises, just fills up with water and then stops and gives the error code.  Could it be the drain pump?   Thanks!Hi Taryn, thank you for your question. The 0e error code means that either your have a clogged drain hose or a clogged/faulty drain pump. If your hoses are not clogged then you will have to replace your drain pump.

After getting error code I turned off machine and came back next morning and ran maintenence pump out just fine. I replaced the drain pump but still have the same issue. No hose kinks or filter blockage noted.\nMy questions  1 Could  this be a logic board problem? 2. Could the pump motor be overheating and shutting down until it cools, than works fine? 3. Maybe the replacement pump was also defect?Hi Steve,\nThank you for your question.  Sometimes the OE error code may be the result if a glitch in the electronic control board.  This can be fixed by turning the power off to the dishwasher for 5 minutes.  If the error code reappears after you have restored power to the dishwasher and you have already checked the pump, the hoses and the filters, then the electronic control board may be defective and you will need to inspect it.

The missing fin should not effect the draining but if it broke off and got lodges or sucked into the pump, it could have damaged the pump.

Open the door and pull out the lower dishrack. Remove the lower sprayarm by turning it counterclockwise. Then turn the fine filter hub nut counterclockwise and remove it. Take the fine filter by the plastic piece and lift the old filter off. Lift up the tab at the base of the water supply tube and remove it. Turn the hub away and take off the filter cover. Release the locking tabs to remove the filter. Push the new filter into the opening until it locks, then reverse the procedure to put your parts back in the dishwasher. \n\nI hope this helps.",

The gasket does not come separately, you may need to replace the entire sump filter and cover assembly, part number PS2370522. This gasket is necessary to retain the cover inlet above the sump filter. If you need help placing an order for it, please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you!",

      "Hi, Our dishwasher started leaking from the bottom. So I took it out and laid it on its side. I then started to take it apart looking for obvious problems, when I discovered that the inlet sump had a tear in its side. After removing it there was a round valve in the bottom of it with a flap that had out printed on it.    It looks like it belongs to the end of the sump filter going by the shape of it.  But I am not sure, plus it doesn't want to stay attached to the sump filter.  What do I do now?Hello Jim, Thank you for the question. I think you are referring to the Check Valve Flapper, PartSelect Number PS258167. If you search up the part there is a how to video on how to install the part. We hope this helps."

      "Should i repair a 10 year old plus kitchen aid dishwasher.  Will not pump water,  heard the washer stop pumping while in use first started.  Like water not getting to pumpHi David,\nThank you for your inquiry.  You can still repair a 10 year old dishwasher.  There are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the drain pump, the sump pump check valve, the chopper assembly, the drain hose, the water inlet valve, the float switch and the bimetal fuse.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "Water is leaking from the bottom front left side.Hi G,\nThank you for your question.  If water is leaking from the dishwasher, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the water inlet valve, the door seal, the seal, the air inlet and the float switch.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "Our dishwasher is leaking. It is filling with clean water when it is not on. We disconnected the power supply and it is no longer filling with water. Which part(s) need(s) to be replaced?Hello Rachel, thank you for your question. It sounds like the water valve is sticking in the open position. We would recommend replacing the water valve first. I hope this helps!",
      "Our dishwasher is leaking into the tub. When it has finished a cycle and sits for a while, open the door and the bottom has clean water sitting in it. Is the water inlet valve letting a little water in when it isn’t running?Hello Robert, thank you for your questions. Yes, I would recommend replacing the water valve for that appliance. It sounds like water is slowly leaking into the unit, and the water to the unit is supplied by the water valve. I hope this helps!",
      "On the fill drain and overfill parts diagram, what is part # 10? Does this component control the amount of water that is filled? If there is an insufficient amount of water in the tub to operate the middle and upper spray bars, could this component be the issue or is it the inlet valve? I am also seeing a water leak from component 10Hello Gerry, Thank you for the question. #10 is the Float Switch Kit,  PartSelect Number PS557009. Water that fills your dishwasher lifts the float, and when it reaches a certain level, the float acts as a trigger for the float switch. The float triggers the switch to shut off, thereby shutting off the flow of water into the dishwasher. I would suggest having this replaced if the appliance is not filling properly. Hope this helps!",
      "My dishwasher is leaking. The water is coming from the bottom part of the door. I have already replaced the door gasket. I removed the wood panel and i see the water coming from both sides. The bolts holding the air inlet were with traces of water so i sealed them, as well as the air inlet in contact with the metal panel, but it's still leaking!!!. i can send pictures with the exact location of the leakage.thanks.Hi Jose, \n\nThank you for your question. We would suggest taking a look at your float switch and your water inlet valve next. It could be that there is too much water getting pushed up into your appliance and perhaps that is why it is leaking. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Can’t find a replacement “check valve” for hose when water being pumped out of dishwasher.  Dishwasher started not draining, but you could click on the “cancel/drain” feature and empty tub. Now, nothing drains. Was told to view and replace this inline plastic “sensor” which was referred to as a “check valve”, but have been unable to find this part for my Kenmore elite dishwasher model:66513153k701. Thought it might be included in drain hose, but not certain from photos and Kenmore website does not show this part on schematics (at least that i could see); is it possible this is part of the “dishwasher water inlet valve” rather than an inline part in the drain hose? Thanks muchHi Nadine,\nThank you for your question.  There is a check valve that is sold with the drain hose.  The part number listed under your model number for the drain hose is PS11756139.

This is a Kenmore elite high efficiency dishwasher, would this be a inlet valve problem? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated thank you.Hi mark, Thank you for the question. It would be caused by the valve or the control board. I suggest checking the resistance in the water inlet valve with an Multi Meter.Hope this helps!",

      "Common line burned , why does this happen and when I put a new one in is it possible to happen again?Hi Stephen, thank you for reaching out. Based on our research, it is a common issue that occurs because of high resistance at the terminal. Corrosion, or a loose connection, can cause the high resistance. The high resistance causes heating, which leads to more heating, and eventually the insulation on the wire starts to melt. We would suggest checking the connections first. If these are fine, the issue could be with the terminal block, part number PS8729475. You may need to replace it to fix the issue. If you install it correctly, hopefully, it will not happen again. We hope this information helps!!"

Not sure how this plastic piece even seals the bottom door.\n\nShould there be some sort of rubber on the bottom seal? Is there something I am missing.Hello Herbert, Thank you for your inquiry. We do not show that there is any rubber on the bottom door seal, which is designed to seal the gap between the opening to the dishwasher tub and the outer edge of the door. You mentioned you replaced the seal around the tub PS11731683 so we would also recommend checking the door seal part# PS12348515. If that does not fix the issue, you may want to look at the filter, drain pump, circulation pump or hoses to see if there is any visible damage. Good luck with your repair.",

    "Product_Description": "\nLower Dishrack Wheel Assembly Specifications\nThis gray plastic lower dishrack roller is a part for your dishwasher. It attaches to the bottom of the lower dishrack, allowing it to move in and out smoothly. If the lower dishrack stops moving in and out easily or preventing you from being able to shut the dishwasher door, inspect the dishrack roller for damage. The assembly includes 2 rollers and the bracket that attaches to the dishrack (parts are not sold separately). This assembly is sold individually, so you will need 4 assemblies to replace them all in your appliance. For this easy repair, start by removing the lower dishrack from the appliance and set it on the counter. Use a screwdriver to pry off the old roller assembly from the lower tabs. Align the new part on the dishrack by snapping it in place.\n",

      "I only need the pin for the wheel assembly, one wheel fell off and i can't find the pin.  Do they sell the wheel and pin separately?  It seems rather costly for the entire assembly.Hi Lois, thank you for your question. Unfortunately no. The axle is not sold without the roller. We apologize that our prices are not as low as you expected. We base our prices on what we are charged by the manufacturer for the parts. We try to keep our prices as low as possible, but do also have to keep them at a level to help cover our costs. We hope this helps to explain the reasoning behind the prices! Good luck with your repair.",

Align the adjustable tines with the middle slot in the roller assembly, then  it should just snap into place on the rack.

If there is no water coming into the dishwasher, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the water inlet valve, the middle spray arm, the upper spray arm mount and the float stem.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "Dishes do not dry completelyHello Joe, thank you for the question. There are several reasons your dishwasher may not be drying your dishes properly. We would recommend making sure the heating element is operational. If it is, then the next part to inspect is the vent. The vent releases hot air during the drying cycle. If the vent is not opening properly, steam can not escape and your dishes will still be wet. Inspect the vent and clean off any debris that may be restricting airflow. If the vent is not opening at all, you will need to replace the vent fan assembly, part number PS12726435. The vent fan assembly circulates air through the door vent to help reduce moisture. We hope this helps!"

ThxHello and thank you for writing.\nIt sounds like the plastic parts might have become faulty due to the heat of the dishwasher, they might not show any damage that would be obvious, but they still might have bend and that could be causing these symptoms. You should consider changing those parts, but do inspect them for damage such as being slightly bent.  We hope this information helps. Please contact us anytime if you require further assistance.",

First, try to press and hold the heated dry button for 5 seconds to see if the control panel will clear the lights(you may have already done this to reset). If that does not fix the issue, your touchpad might be shorted out or stuck.Try to heat up the buttons with a hair dryer and massage the buttons. Try to reset again and if this does not fix the issue you may have to replace the touch pad. Hope this helps!",

You can test to see if it is the touchpad or the control board, by unplugging the dishwasher, open the door and console, then unplug the touchpad ribbon from the control board, replace the console. Leaving the door open, reconnect the power, then after 5-7 seconds shut the dishwasher door. The appliance is usually programmed to turn on the drain pump if it does not detect the touchpad. If the drain pump comes on, then the control board is fine and the touchpad would need to be replaced. Otherwise, replace the control board.  Good luck with your repair.",

      "The arm that sits under the upper basket has come off our dishwasher.  It appears that it just clips on to the upper basket.  Is that right?  Does it mount to the back wall of the unit?Thank you.Hi Mike,\n\nThank you for the question. The arm clips onto the conduit tube and the tube clips to the bottom of the rack. The tube then goes to the back of the appliance where the water feed tube is. \n\nHope this helps!",
      "I don't think my upper spinner is spinning as it used too.  Is there a seal that goes on between the rack and the upper water outlet?  Spinner dose not look to have debris in it at all.Hello Joe, thank you for writing. There is not a seal in between the rack and upper water outlet. It could be that the connections are worn or loose. The mid/Upper Arm is part PS12753867. The Conduit the arm connects to is part PS6883615. However, the arm is basically powered by the water pressure from the Water Inlet  Valve part PS16217027.So, if it is malfunctioning that could affect how fast or how much pressure is applied to the dishes. If you need help placing an order, customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you."

Without this clamp, the hose is vulnerable to leaking and disconnecting from the tub during the wash cycle of the washer, which can present a serious safety hazard for the machine and your home. Clamps can wear out and lose their tension due to excessive vibrations, mechanical damage, and normal wear and tear, all things present within a washing machine. To replace this clamp, you will first need to turn off your washer and you will need access to the lower portion of the washer chassis, which may require one or multiple screwdrivers and wrenches. Once you have access, use your screwdriver to loosen this clamp, which can then be removed and replaced with the new clamp, which will need to be tightened securely. Then you can simply reassemble the rest of the washer you originally disassembled.\n",

Also, the light for \"start/resume\" \"cancel\" & \"clean\" do not light up.  What part do i need for this crappy dishwasher?Hi Laurie, Thank you for the question. This sounds like a defective control board, Part Number: PS11722934. The board is not repairable so it will need to be replaced. Hope this helps!"

If your dishwasher does not dispense detergent, is broken and worn out, or the door is not opening properly, replacing the dispenser spring could be the solution. For this replacement you will need needle nose pliers. First, release the cover on the detergent dispenser, then remove the cover from the shaft it hinges on. Pull the shaft from one side and remove the spring from the shaft. Next, replace with the new spring and engage the two open hooks into the soap cover. Finally, grasp the hook and pull it over tab on the side of the wash cup. Verify that it works properly by opening and closing the cap. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further instructions.\n",

      "The soap dispenser sometimes has soap left after washing and dishes are not clean. A few times the door of dispenser is not open. Which parts should I replace? Thanks!Hello Ling, Thank you for your inquiry. If the dispenser is not opening and releasing the soap, then check the parts of the dispenser such as the seal, the spring and the lid. The seal is only available as part of the complete dispenser assembly. It could also be caused by the water not being hot enough so we would recommend checking the water circulation pump with heater and make sure that the water going into the dishwasher is hot. You can test the pump with a multimeter. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, we have videos available to assist you. We hope this helps.",
      "Soap dispenser doesn’t open during cycle \nBut when I manually turn the knob through each cycle it opens.Hi Alvin, thank you for contacting us. The issue probably seems to be with the dispenser actuator assembly, part number PS392727. It opens the dispenser cover to release detergent and rinse aid during the dishwashing cycle. If you require assistance to place an order, please contact customer service!"

      "Were do l put the ballHello David, thank you for your question. The filter ball goes into the inlet sump. the filter ball blocks the path to the fine filter during the drain cycle. If its missing or jammed it can cause incomplete draining. Pull out the dish racks from the unit so you can access the bottom section of the dishwasher. Remove the spray arm and the filter cover from the bottom of the dishwasher. Remove the ball from the round tube that sits towards the back of the opening. To remove the filter, use some chewing gum, or sticky tack on the end of a straw and insert it into the tube to grab and remove the ball (if its still in the hole). Simply drop the new ball into that hole and reassemble. I hope this helps!",

I suggest checking and cleaning out the filter PartSelect Number: PS1765973 and sump PartSelect Number PS1765981. Make sure there is no damage or blockage. You can also check the Drain Solenoid,PartSelect Number PS1481923 to see if the plunger is moving up and down properly. If everything checks out good, you may need to replace the pump. Hope this helps!",

      "My filter ball is sitting inside the water divertor assembly in my dishwasher is this not the correct location for this model?    I have had a sudden decreases in water to my mid arm that is so poor that the arm does not spin.Hello Brad, thank you for contacting us. The filter ball goes into the inlet sump. The filter ball blocks the path to the fine filter during the drain cycle. The filter ball is in the correct location. If the middle arm is not spinning and there is less water coming from it, it is due to the clogged spray arm. You may need to check the spray arm, part number PS16542477, to fix the issue. We hope this helps!",
      "I have a 2 1/2 year old GE dishwasher Model # GDT535PSMBSS.  In the small well under the filter, we normally have seen a small orange plastic ball laying in the well directly under the drain filter that we easily remove monthly and clean (the filter - not the ball). Yesterday the orange ball got stuck in one of the drain valves, causing my dishwasher not to work.  I went to the store to see other new GE dishwashers, and none of them have an orange plastic ball in the well directly under the drain filter.  I was able to remove the stuck ball from the valve, but I'm hesitant to reposition it freely in the well directly under the drain filter, as it might get stuck in the drain valve once again when I'm able to reoperate the dishwasher.  Is the orange ball supposed to freely lay in the well directly under the drain filter, or is it supposed to be located elsewhere within the drain filter area?Hello John, thank you for reaching out. Based on our research, the filter ball lays freely under the sump filter. You just simply need to drop the ball into that hole. We hope this information helps!"

      "My Kenmore dishwasher works perfectly...except the soap dispenser door won't open while the machine is cycling.  i can open it manually.  can you tell me from the exploded diagrams if the dispenser uses a wax solenoid, or a hinge pin or if the electric harness is what needs to be replaced to make the dispenser door open during wash cycles?Hi Paula, \n\nThank you for your question. Yes it does use a wax motor. It is likely that you would have to replace your dispenser to fix that issue. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",

In this case the dispenser would need to be replaced, PartSelect Number PS11754645. Hope this helps!",

When rinsing, i do not see the same leakage. Can you help me find the possible problem? I am planning to change the door gasket just to see if it helps. I order one from you. Thank you so much.Hello Virna, thank you for your question. It sounds like the bottom door seal needs to be replaced. When the soap is dispensed and runs down the door you're getting that leak.

I have tried adjusting the u shaped metal latch on the diswahser, but it still pops open. Thinking i might need the latch on the door?? thanks. sueHello Sue, that is a great question. For the rinse dispenser you can only get the cap as a separate part, anything else you would need to purchase the whole dispenser - PS11750655. For the door it sounds like a new latch and strike may be needed. Door latch PS886294 and Door strike PS11746708. Hope this helps!",

There is a video on our website that you can reference on how to install the heating element.  The dishwasher in the video may not show exactly like the one you have, but it will give you a general idea on how to install the part.  You will find the video under part number PS2355742.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",

      "The dishwasher was not cleaning or drying dishes, so we purchased the heating coil and thermostat and replaced.  The dishes are now getting clean, but it is not drying them completely, there is water on especially the silverware(the tray is in the door).I'd appreciate any help you can give as we already spent $102 hoping these items would fix it as its out of warranty.  not sure how much money we should spend on it, its only been used for 2 years.Hello Roberta. Thanks for your question. I do know that rinse aid is very important to your appliance being able to dry your dishes properly. If you are using rinse aid then the problem might lie in your control board. The electronic control board is PartSelect Number: PS11737960- this is rarely the issue, but it could be worth cutting off power to the dishwasher for one minute and then restarting it to see if that fixes the issue before replacing the board. I hope this helps.",
      "My dishwasher doesn't always dissolve the detergent pod and when that happens it doesn't do the heated dry either.   Do you think it would be the heating element?Hi Kim ,\n\nThank you for your question. That would be the first part that I would suggest checking. You should test this part with a multi meter to see if it is working correctly. You may also want to test your thermal fuse as well. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",

      "How to install the heating element for the dishwasher model wdt790saym2.I want instructions specifically for this model to pull the dishwasher from under the countertop and replacing the heating element before ordering the parts.Hello Sri, Thank you for your inquiry. To pull the dishwasher out from under the countertop. Shut off the electricity at the breaker. Tip: place a piece of tape over the breaker switch to ensure no one turns it on while you're working. Turn off the water under the sink. Take off the front cover at the bottom of the dishwasher to expose the wiring. Use a voltage meter to test the wires at the dishwasher to ensure the power is still off. Remove the electrical box from the unit. Unscrew the wire nuts and pull apart the wires. Start with the green wires, white and then black. Disconnect the drain line from the dishwasher and the water supply line from the dedicated dishwasher stop. Open the door to the dishwasher, then remove the screws secured to the underside of the countertop. Raise the legs using a wrench. Slowly pull out the dishwasher ensuring the wires are out of the way. Also, the drain line should come out with the dishwasher from under the sink. Tip: Place a drop cloth or piece of cardboard in front of the dishwasher to prevent scratches on the floor. Also, before turning electricity back on, make sure to tape or cap off the ends of the three exposed wires. Although we do not have a repair video for this exact model for the heating element, I have included a video link for a similar Whirlpool heating element. Hope this helps!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Co8dQ7rzTMQ&index=25&list=PLD984081941E1E8CD",

      "Dishwasher does not dry.  Testing heating element and thermostat for continuity, both test ok, although heating element doesn’t show complete continuity(0.08 ipo 0.00). Should i still suspect the heating element?Hello Joe. Thanks for your question. The issue could be the electronic control board is PS11731265 - this is rarely the issue, but it could be worth cutting off power to the dishwasher for one minute and then restarting it to see if that fixes the issue before replacing the board. The heating element should read between 8 and 30 ohms. If the element is testing good, I would suggest checking the thermostat, part number PS11750035. I hope this helps!"

    "Product_Description": "\nVALVE ACCESS Specifications\nThis water access valve, also known as a water inlet valve, is an authentic OEM replacement part used in dishwashers. The valve controls the flow of water into the dishwasher. It is responsible for allowing water from the household water supply to enter the dishwasher tub during the wash cycle. The valve is controlled by the electronic control board, which signals it to open or close based on the selected cycle and water level requirements. Once the dishwasher is filled to the appropriate level, the water inlet valve closes to prevent any further water from entering the tub. If the valve is faulty, you will likely experience water leakages, difficulties filling dishwasher, and poor cleaning results. This part is commonly associated with the E15 error code on dishwashers.\n",

      "I get a watertap fault about a minute after turning on the dishwasherHello Jim, thank you for your inquiry. This should be fairly easy to reset. Just press and hold the start button for 5 seconds to reset the dishwasher. Then turn the power off for 15 seconds and turn the power back on. If you are unable to reset it, turn off the dishwasher's breaker for 5 minutes to allow the capacitors to bleed. After that, you should be good to go again. If it does not help, the first thing you want to do is pull it out and make sure the water line is not kinked, the water supply valve is on, the pump filter is clean, and the pump runs. If the inlet hose has a detachable filter, also clean it. If all is well and still an error is showing, you need to replace the water inlet valve, part number PS16746057. Please reach out to customer service if you need help placing an order. Glad to be of help!",
      "Part nr PS16746057 leaking at the hose connection, even with a new washer. Dont really trust the hose thread/rubber washer connection. Does this part come with pipe thread option instead?Hi Karl, thank you for reaching out. The valve access, part number PS16746057, is threaded on one side. On another side, there is a small groove. We hope this information is useful!",
      "e:19 error.  Drained power from board overnight. repower and goes to error right away.  Board is clean and dry.  no water in bottom of washerHello Jeffrey, thank you for contacting us. First, reboot your device, letting it rest for 15 minutes. If you still see the code after plugging in and switching your device back on, you should check both the pump and the heat exchanger in order to determine the cause of the error and try to fix it. The pump has to be checked with a multimeter and replaced if needed. To get to it, you have to first disconnect the drain filter, which is placed inside the tank of your machine. Then turn your device upside-down and take off the bottom panel. Detach the pump, part number PS11704799, and carefully inspect it. As for the heater, remove the left panel to get to it. Check it for visible signs of damage and examine the drain valve. It can be easily detached by turning it clockwise and pulling it out. If you see that the components are faulty, replace them with new ones. If you do not have a recirculating valve, replace the main control board. It is made for multiple models, so if it is getting an error for a valve that does not exist on your dishwasher, the main board, part number PS12729567, is failing and needs to be replaced. We hope this information helps!"

      "Dishes on upper rack do not get cleanHi Cathy,\nThank you for your question.  If the dishes on the upper rack are not getting clean, there are some things that you will need to check to see what is causing the issue.  There may be something blocking the spray arm preventing the water from reaching the upper rack.  Check to make sure that there are no obstructions. If the dishwasher is overloaded, this can prevent your dishwasher from cleaning properly.  The holes where the water comes out of on the spray arm may be clogged and you will either have to clean the holes out or replace the spray arm. If the dishes are not placed correctly in the rack, this can prevent them from being cleaned properly. Cups and bowls should face down or otherwise water will collect in them.   The face of each dish should face toward the center of the dishwasher. Place glasses between spindles rather than on or over them so that water doesn't get trapped. If the water pressure is low going into your dishwasher the dishes on the top rack may not get clean. This can be caused by a kink in the dishwasher hose or low water pressure to your home. If it happens only occasionally, it may be caused by other appliances or activities using water, such as the clothes washer, bathtub and sprinklers.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",

      "Top spinner and spray arm do not turn.Hello Wanda, thank you for your question. The first thing we recommend doing is removing the top spinner and cleaning it very well. Make sure its attached securely and that the part is not clogged. It would also be a good idea to check under the bottom spray arm for any clogs or debris that may be down in the sump, if the sump is clogged the water will not be pushed through to the other spray arms. If these sections are clear, we would recommend checking the back manifold tube, and where it connects to the bottom of the dishwasher. I hope this helps!",
      "The top rack items aren't cleaning well at all.  Could it be the top spinner center part or the entire top spinner part.Should the top spinner mechanism wobble at all?Hi Deb,\nThank you for your question.  If the dishes on the top rack are not getting cleaned, then it could be the top spinner.  The top spinner should not be wobbling and it should run smoothly. Make sure the holes in the spray arms are not clogged with debris. Make sure the water is hot when using the dishwasher.  Run the water in the tap for a few minutes until it is good and hot and then run the dishwasher.  Make sure there is adequate water pressure going to the dishwasher.  Also, check to make sure the heating element in the dishwasher is working correctly if not, this can prevent the dishes from getting cleaned correctly.  How you arrange the dishes in the dishwasher is important as well.  If they are arranged in a way that will prevent the water from reaching the dishes on the top rack, then this will prevent them from getting cleaned. There are some other parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the chopper assembly, the spray arm seal, the sump pump check valve, the impeller and seal kit, the circulation pump and motor, the water supply manifold probe, the lower spray arm, the feed tube and the sump and motor assembly. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",

Unless this kit has been redesigned and it doesn’t need it? What’s going on?Hi Annette, this spray arm has been newly designed by the manufacturer and no longer comes with a support. Please let me know if you have any further questions.",
      "Having a problem with my dishwasher. It isn’t washing. So checked for blockage and replaced both racks because they were getting grimey. What should I check next?Hello Sandy, we recommend checking to see if the water level inside the dishwasher is low. If it is, you need to replace the water valve. If the water level is normal, you should remove the filters and clean them. If the filters are in bad condition you may need to replace them. Best of luck with this repair.",

It is just the rubber tube that needs replacing.... will i need a mount as well or will it fit the current one? there is  a screw in the top basketHi Liz, thank you for your question. This part does fit your appliance. If you only need to replace the tube that your spray attaches to, I have linked that part down below for you. Good luck with your repair.",

I haven’t been doing anything differently but I think I have a problem with my dishwasher.

If your filters are clear it is most likely a problem with the choppers. We will need your model number to know for sure. I hope this helps.",

It is responsible for spraying water onto the dishes that are placed in the top rack. It is located beneath the top rack and consists of several small openings or nozzles through which water is propelled with high pressure. When the dishwasher is in running, water is pumped through the spray arm, and the force of the water causes it to rotate, ensuring that water is distributed evenly across the dishes for effective cleaning. If the arm become damaged or clogged with debris, you may notice difficulties cleaning your dishes properly, rattling or scraping sounds and reduced overall efficiency.\n",

      "Dryer no power what can i doHello Tai, thank you for your question. There are a few parts you will want to test to determine if they have failed and caused this issue. We would recommend testing the Part Number: WP3392519 thermal fuse, Door Switch - 3 Wire Part Number: WP3406107, and Thermostat, Internal-Bias Part Number: WP8577274. Testing the thermostats is an easy process. Set your multimeter to the R X 1 setting. Take each of your meter's probes and touch one to each terminal. You are testing for continuity, and you should receive a reading of either zero or infinity. At room temperature, testing the thermostat should produce a reading of zero. But if a thermostat is tested when it is heated to its limit, a reading of infinity should be produced. We strongly recommend that you test your thermostat at room temperature. If those parts are tested and are fine, please check the power cord and terminal block a well as the outlet that the unit is plugged into. I hope this helps!"

If the drain hose is not draining and you have replaced the drain pump, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.

      "How do you remove the broken part installed a new one? Part ps11756150Hi Val,\nThank you for your inquiry.  Before beginning any repair please unplug the dishwasher and wear gloves to protect your hands. Release the track stops from the upper dishrack rails and pull the upper rack from the dishwasher and place it upside down on a work surface.  Raise the wheels to the maximum height.  Release the top of the long rear clip from the dishrack tine and push the clip down to the release point and remove it.  Press the tab down on the front clip move the clip up to pull it off. Release the locking tabs  on the clip in the middle of the height adjuster and remove the clip. Using a slot screw driver pry the housing cover down and out to release the upper tabs on each side.  Pry the bottom of the housing cover out of the 2 lower locking tabs.  Pull the housing cover off the rack.  Remove the adjuster housing and wheel assembly and repeat the procedure on the other side.  Slide the vertical portion on the new wheel assembly between the fourth set of vertical tines from the back of the dishrack and rotate the wheel assembly so that it lays flat against the side.  Insert a positioner clip above the rear wheel and snap the tab into the slot.  Install a positioner clip on the front wheel.  Position the adjuster body over the vertical portion of the wheel assembly and push in into the slots. Locking tabs at the bottom of the adjuster body engage the the wheel assembly once it is fully inserted the tabs.  Insert the actuator lever into the adjuster body with the thumb pad facing the front of the rack.  Two half circle cut outs on the adjuster body hold the actuator in place.  Push the adjuster body down and install the adjuster cover.  Install the adjuster cover mounting screws.  Repeat this process on the other side of the rack.  Push the upper dishrack onto its tracks.  Close the track stops on the rails and the repair is done. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "Are there video installation instructions for replacing the adjuster part w10546503Hello Mark, Thank you for your inquiry. At this time, we do not have a video for this exact part number but I have found instructions for you. Use a small flat head screwdriver to depress the retaining tabs securing the rack adjustors to the tracks. Fully remove the upper rack. Using the flat blade screwdriver, release the tabs to detach the adjuster housing cover and remove the housing. Next detach the front and rear adjuster support straps from the tines and remove them from the rack adjuster. Note the orientation of the rack adjuster, then pry off the stop clip to detach the old adjuster. Install the new adjuster by aligning it on the rack and snap the stop clip into place to secure. Next replace the front and rear support straps. Position the adjuster housing by aligning the locking lever in the adjuster slot then snap the cover on to secure. Then put the upper rack back into place.  Hope this helps!",
      "The part that i'm  finding on line for a upper rack adjustment mechanism  does not look the same as the one on my dish washer and we could not locate the model number on the dishwasher where would we locate that on the unitHello Violet, Thank you for your inquiry. You would locate your model number on the left edge of the dishwasher's door, on the upper left hand corner of the unit's frame, on the top of the door jamb-to the left, right, or in the center, on the door itself, to the left, right or in the center, or on the underside of the control panel. Hope this helps!",
      "I used the adjuster to lower the right side of top rack. Now the door will not close. I can't turn the dishwasher on.Hello Rochelle, Thank you for the question. I suggest putting the rack back to the normal setting in height to see if the door will close. If the door closes you may need to replace the adjuster. It might be causing the rack to come forward and not allow the door to close properly. Hope this helps!",

The new rack adjuster kit provided by the manufacturer provides all the replacement parts for the right and left sides of that rack.

      "Does this part come with both sides and are they also available in stainless steel?Hi Elton, thank you for the great question. We have found that the part you mentioned does not come with both sides and is sold separately. This part is only available in plastic, it does not come in stainless steel.

I have all of my buttons however I find them very difficult to fit into the cover plate.Hello Amber, Thank you for the question. Very sorry we do not have a picture at this time.

      "I need to change all the rollers and axels on my bottom rack according to my neighbor but I don’t know how many rollers there are supposed to be on the bottom rack and I don’t know how many “kits” I need to order. Pls helpHello Darleen, no problem, we can help! On the lower dishrack in your dishwasher there are 4 rollers on each side, bringing the total rollers or wheels up to 8. Each wheel/roller also needs an axel. This kit comes with 8 rollers and 8 axels. That means you should order only one of these kits if you wish to replace all the rollers and axels on your lower dishrack. I hope this helped.",
      "I purchased this kit for the lower rack on my dishwasher (GE) as you suggested and the axels are different then the ones on my dw. The ones on my dw snap in on the side at an angle but the new ones fit straight onto the rack. Will these ones still work? ThanksHi Terry, the studs in the lower rack wheel kit WD35X21038 were redesigned by the manufacturer. They may look different but they are compatible with your model, and will work for your lower dishrack. Best of luck with this repair!",
      "I do not understand hwo to attach the wheel to it the axel and to attach the axel to the dishwasher. Help?!Hi Cory, great question! On your lower dishrack, you have 8 wheels/rollers and 8 axels. The axels are inserted into the wheels/rollers. Once the wheel is stable and attached, the other end of the axel fastens onto the lower dishrack. Please let us know if you have any other questions.",
      "I need some help deciding between this wheel pack kit and the single wheel part number: Ps259136 when i only need one wheel at this time.  Other wheels are loose and often come off when sliding lower rack in and out of dishwasher.  Are the wheels in this kit equal in size to the single wheel?Hi Edward,\n\nThank you for your question. The wheels in the kit are the same size as the wheel that is sold individually. They would both work with your lower dishrack. So it just depends if you want to buy a package of them or just singular parts. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Why is my lower rack on dishwasher rusting?Hi Arlene, Thank you for the question.Unfortunately I can not say why your rack is rusting for sure. It could have has a split or defect in the coating and water got into the metal parts and rusted. Hope this helps!",

      "Is there a procedure on your website that documents how to remove the switch from the control panel?Hello Brent! Thank you for your question! The first step is to shut power off to the appliance. Open door and remove the three screws on either side of the door that holds the outer door panel. Slide the panel down and pull out away from the door. Remove the 6 screws at the top of the door that holds the control panel and pull off. Don't mix the screws, they are different sizes. The top control panel screws are longer than the outer door panel screws. Use a flat head screwdriver push in the locking tab and remove the switch wire connector. Removed the switch support. Using the flat head screwdriver lift the tab on the side of the switch and slide it to the left. Reinstall by inserting the switch with the cutouts on the sides to make sure they are fitting over the tabs and slide the switch to the right until it locks into place. Install the switch support, plug in the wire connector and place the control panel to the door and secure it with the screws. The door panel would be reinstalled at this point and then you can shut the door. Power can be turned on to the unit at this point and your done! I hope this helps!",

The diverter motor leaks either because of a faulty diffuser, part number PS11755348, or the diverter motor itself is damaged. We would suggest checking the diffuser before replacing the motor.

      "My dishwasher is dripping from what appears to be the bottom of the diverter motor, is it that part i should replace?Hi Greg, thank you for your inquiry. If your dishwasher is leaking from the motor area, then most probably the diverter motor, part number PS11730993, is damaged. A dishwasher's diverter motor operates a diverter disc to redirect the water to the upper spray arm or arms. If the motor itself is damaged, it can potentially leak water behind the lower access panel. Inspect the motor housing for any cracks, if it is faulty, you may need to replace the diverter motor.  We hope this information helps!",

      "Overwhelming burning rubber type smell when water coming in or going outHi Christine, thank you for your question! Your dishwasher has a heating element that is used to heat up water and to speed up moisture removal from your dishes and your appliance's interior. If you notice a burning plastic smell coming from your dishwasher while it is in use, it could be the case that plastic has come into contact with the heating element. A clogged or dirty filter can also lead to a burning smell in the dishwasher. If food particles and debris build up in the filter, they can become overheated and emit a burning odor. Loose or damaged wiring can also cause electrical issues in your dishwasher. Check for any frayed wires or loose connections and tighten them if necessary. Inspect the heating element, part number PS8260087, in your dishwasher for any signs of damage or wear. If you notice any cracks or breaks in the element, it will need to be replaced. We hope this information helps!"

      "Hi I am getting error code bE  on my  lg dishwasher.  I   have levelled   the dishwasher and   am using the correct detergent  there are no soap suds in the dishwasher   and i am still getting the bE error code,  could it be the diverter motor causing the bE  code please help??Hello Agotino, thank you for reaching out. The bE error code is triggered by improper detergent use or a dishwasher that is not level. Using the wrong detergent leads to excess sudsing, causing parts like the vent to become filled with soap foam. A dishwasher that is not level will do the same, causing water to flow to parts where it does not belong, potentially damaging components. To fix the issue adjust leveling feet as necessary. To remove detergent residue in the tub pour approximately three to seven ounces of milk into a shallow bowl and place it in the upper rack and run the dishwasher on the Auto cycle. We hope this solves your problem!",

To replace the outer tub seal your first step is to open the dishwasher door and remove the mounting bracket screws. Now pull the dishwasher a couple of inches away from the cabinet. If you have difficulty moving the dishwasher, you may need to disconnect the hoses and electrical wires. With the dishwasher pulled out, unsnap the top to the old tub seal and lift it off.

Even more strange, if i have the door open and manually activate the door switch then press start it starts filling with water every time.  Additionally, occasionally the washer will not drain.   All the lights seem to be performing normally, i opened the dishwasher up and checked all components i could with a multimeter including the door swith (works perfectly, i even removed the door strike plate and manually inserted it into the door switch with the door open and it started filling with water just fine.)  i also tested the bimetal fuse, high limit thermostat, heating element.  The float switch did occasionally not make a great connection but i disassembled the micro switch and cleaned it up now the float switch works perfectly with the floatswitch/filling valve circuit testing at the right resistance.  So i am kind of at a loss for what to do now.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.Hello Derek, thank you for your question. It sounds like there is an issue with either the control panel or the electronic control board. All the parts tested already are ones we would recommend checking first. Since all those parts have been tested and are working correctly, we would recommend checking the connections between the control panel and board, as well as the wiring harness to the switches. Something if there is a burnt or loose wire that can cause a bad connection between the controls and board. If the wires are find and connected well the issue is most likely with the board or the control panel. I hope this helps!",
      "Hello, my dishwasher is not completing any cycle. Power shuts off completely for a few minutes, then comes back with flashing start/resume Green led. Tried replacing hi limit thermostat and turbidity sensor but no luck, same issue. Its not the door switch, checked continuity. Could the problem be the float switch? Thanks for your help.Hi John,\nThank you for your question.  If your dishwasher is not completing its cycle, there are a couple of reasons why this is happening.  One is the door not closing properly.  Another issue is the overloading of the dishwasher.  A dishwasher has a maximum load limit. When dishes are loaded properly, they are exposed to water but, when rinsed, are heated and dried. Improper loading can lead to a lack of drying and even an inability for the washer to drain dirty water. This may result in the dishwasher stopping just before the rinse cycle. This may also keep the door from shutting completely.  Another reason is there may be a lack of water entering the dishwasher.  If so, you will need to check the water pressure going into the dishwasher or there could be a clog in the water inlet valve.  Also, if the heating element is not working correctly, this can cause the dishwasher cycle to end prematurely. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "Hello, my dishwasher cut off power before the heating cycle. After a few minutes, the start/resume light starts blinking and the machine will start again but cut off power again when the heating cycle start. I've replaced the hi limit thermostat, checked continuity on the heating element and door switch. I also tried replacing the owi sensor. Checked the main control board, looks ok, no burn marks. Please help! Thanks.Hello John, thank you for inquiring. For this symptom you will want to replace either the Door Latch and Switch Assembly part PS11754317, the Control Panel part PS11749141, or the Electronic Control Board part PS11752012. It could also be the Heating Element part PS11748194. A faulty Heating Element will cause the dishwasher to stop. We hope this helps.",
      "Dishwasher starts and runs through cycle but is not draining properly.  There is an inch of water left in the bottom after the cycle is complete and the indicator light says the dishes are clean.  I have run the cycle with the drain tube in a bucket and it appears to be filling and pumping ok during the wash cycle.  I have also checked the accumulator and filter and they are clean and unobstructed.  Is this likely a control board or float switch issue? Any thoughts are appreciated.Hi Mark, thank you for reaching out. Based on the description you have provided, we would suggest checking the drain hose for any blockage first. If it is fine, the issue could be with the drain pump, part number PS11753379. You may need to replace it to fix the issue. We hope this solves your problem!"

      "Do you have a video on how to fixHi Sharon, Thank you for the question. We do not have a video as of yet for this Door Latch Bolt but here are some steps to install the part. First disconnect the dishwasher from the electrical supply. You will need to remove the inner door panel to access the door latch assembly. Disconnect the end of the door springs from the door spring adjustment holes in the frame. Open the dishwasher door and remove the eight 8 Torx screws securing the inner door panel from the door panel.Slide the inner door panel back toward the dishwasher to disengage the locking tab from the door panel. Lift the door panel away from the door.Hope this helps!",

Yes, there should be a spring, Part Number: PS815938 on both sides of the door. It could also be the parts you got local. They are not always OEM parts and may not work on your model. It could also happen if you only replaced one side. Sometime both sides need to be replaced at the same time. If you only had one side before it could have become wore out.

      "Our KitchenAid dishwasher has stopped draining completely—there’s always standing water at the end of the cycle, but it’s not overflowing so i suspect it’s a problem with the drain pump rather than a clogged drain. I cleared the garbage disposal and i removed the accumulator and filter and cleared out any debris in there (found some broken glass), but still it won’t drain. Does it sound like the pump is the issue and needs to be replaced?Hello Liz, Thank you for your inquiry. It does sound like it but also make sure that there are no leaks or clogs in the drain hose. You can test the pump with a multimeter. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, there are YouTube videos available to assist you.  Hope this helps!",
      "Hello - my dishwasher works well but has developed a noise when it begins the drain cycle and continues through end of cycle.  The water appears to drain completely.  Other than the noise being annoying, the system functions properly.  Am i correct in assuming the drain pump is the likely the source?  Is there a fix other than replacement.  Your thoughts would be appreciated.  Thanks!Hi Ron,\nThank you for your inquiry.  Based on what you described, it does sound like the issue with the drain pump, if there is any debris trapped inside the pump you can try to clean but you may have to replace it.      You will also need to check the sump as well as the accumulator and filter to see if there is any debris in these parts as well.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "My dishwasher does not drain at the end of the wash cycle. I have checked the sump area, all the hoses, the chopper assembly, etc. And have narrowed the problem down to (i hope) the drain pump (part number 661658). The impeller is clean, turns freely, and was free of debris, yet it appears to be the most likely problem. The repair manual says that the resistance of the windings (between the two terminals) should be 16.3 ohms. My multimeter reading is about 24-25 ohms. Does this definitively point to a bad pump winding or not? One responder to this site said that his new unit read 24 ohms. How can this be possible. Thank you.Hi James,\nThank you for your question.  Use your multimeter to test the solenoid for resistance. Set your meter to the R x 1 setting. Place each of the meter's probes on one terminal each. When the probes touch the terminals, the reading should change from a reading of infinity to a reading of approximately forty ohms. If you receive a reading of infinity, or a reading that is no where near 40 ohms, then you will need to replace the solenoid.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "I am still confused by your previous answer to my question. If the owner's manual states that the resistance reading for the drain pump motor (drain winding) should be 16.3 ohms where does this 40 ohm reading come from? Which is the proper reading 16.3 or 40 ohms? My presumed faulty motor winding reads about 24-25 ohms does this make it faulty? There are 2 questions here, please answer both. Thank you.Hi James, thank you for your question. The 40 ohms is the information that we have but it is general information. If you have more specific information from your manual then you should go by that. Either way though, if your motor is not reading either of the ohm readings (the one that your manual states and the one we gave you) then that would probably mean the motor is faulty. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Forgot which wire went where.  Drain pump has 2 connection points, n and l (neutral and lead I am assuming).  Both wires are grey but one has a black line running through it.

Unfortunately the manufacturer does not always give instructions with their parts. However the easiest way to make sure that you are connecting the wires back to where they are supposed to go, is to take a picture of your old board before removing any wires. Another way would be to hold your new board up against your old board and just transfer the wires that way. Good luck with your repair.",

Perhaps bad inlet valve itself??  makes no noise when starting cycle and no water at all inside. any suggestions?Hi Brian, thank you for your question. I would say it might be your valve. Sometimes even if it is electrically testing good, it might be mechanically not working correctly. If it is not that part then the only other part that I would suggest would be your electronic board that might be the issue. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Hi, i can hear my dishwasher fill and drain and it seems to go through all the cycles.  When indicated by the light it is complete and the door is opened there is steam in the unit but the detergent is sitting in a pile on the bottom and the dishes were never washed.  This does not change for any of the wash cycle options.Hi Aaron, thank you for you question. I might suggest checking your water inlet valve to make sure that enough water is being brought into your appliance. You may also want to make sure the water pressure from your home is good as well. If that is fine you should go on to check for blockages in the filter and tubing of your appliance. Make sure the water is able to flow freely and strongly. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",

I can hear it running through cycle but dishes are all dirty.(even bottom ones) I checked for debris in the bottom screen and washing arms. Suggestions?Hello Kirsten, Thank you for the question. If the tub is not filling up to the bottom of the element, there is not enough water to circulate and clean properly. We suggest checking the Water Inlet Valve. We hope this helps!",
      "How to check water inlet valve solenoid. Should the solenoid contact must have a continuity? Please let me now how to properly check the water inlet valve. ThanksHi Mohammad,\nThank you for your question.  Before performing this test, unplug the dishwasher from the electrical outlet and turn the water off.  With a multimeter, set the device to the ohms setting x 1. Touch each of the meter's probes to a terminal. If you receive a reading of infinity, it means the valve's solenoid is faulty and the valve needs to be replaced. If your valve has two solenoids (four terminals), test the second pair of terminals in the same manner. If either pair of terminals receives a result of infinity, replace the water inlet valve. We hope this helps!  If you have any questions, please let us know.",

I have opened up the bottom of the machine and had all the hoses apart, and everything seems to be clear of blockages.  Any ideas?Hi Randy,\nThank you for your question.  If the dishwasher is not draining correctly, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.

      "The cable that holds the springs for the door broke and the fix seems fairly simple, except i'm not 100% sure where the cable attaches to the door. Both cables fell off when the one broke, so i don't know where they were originally attached to the door and i can't find a video or picture anywhere that shows where they attach. Can you provide any help on this, the instructions i found on your site were not clear enough for me to verify the correct location.Hi Gary,\n\nThank you for your question.

There are a few parts that you should check when you are having this issue. The first parts to check would be your filters and tubing and spray arms. You will want to check that there is absolutely no debris blocking the paths for the water to run smoothly. You may also want to take a look at your water inlet valve as well and make sure enough water is going into the appliance. If those parts are all fine, then the problem might actually be in your Pump and Motor. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",

Generally for an issue like this the door latch would be one of the parts to check. If that part is fine you may want to check the wiring for any damage. If those parts are both fine then it may be your control that is the issue. We have a 30 day Return Policy. More information can be found here: https://www.partselect.com/Thirty-Day-Returns.htm.

There is no noticible wear on the latch assembly although the unit is about 20 years old.  I have tried bending down the strike plate a little bit and did not make a difference.  It currently takes a fair amount of force to push the door shut to get it to latch.Hello Jim, thank you for reaching out. According to our research, you may need to check the following parts: the door balance link kit, part number PS972325, the left and right door hinges, part numbers PS11746184, and PS11746183.

      "My dishwasher seems to go through an entire cycle but it does not distribute the soap at all.Hello Joy, Thank you for the question. If the dispenser is not opening and allowing the soap to dispense it is a indication the motor on the back of the dispenser is defective. The motor is not sold on its own so the dispenser, PartSelect Number PS11773088 will need to be replaced. You can use a multi meter to test the motor and check for continuity. If the motor is good, you may have a defective control board. Hope this helps!",
      "Fills with water but won’t wash then drainsHello Nick, thank you for your question. There are a few parts you will need to test to determine what the issue is. If the water is not going through the spray arms, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue. You will need to check the filter, the turbidity sensor, spray arms (for any debris stuck in the holes) and the diverter motor. I hope this helps. Thank you and have a great day!",

I could not find a senor in the parts lists. Thanks for your assistance.Hi David, Thank you for the question. You can try to teat the Thermostat, PartSelect Number PS11750035 for continuity. If the thermostat tests good you will need to replace or test the elements its self. Hope this helps!",

After dishwasher cycle is done the sanitized light on the front panel flashes. We rep[laced the heating element and it didn't fix the problem. What is the problem?Hello Joe, thank you for your question. I would suggest testing the thermostat part number WPW10195091 to see if that is faulty before replacing the board. If the thermostat is testing 0 ohms at room temperature, the part is not bad, and then the board should be replaced. I hope this helps!",

      "The control panel is totally unresponsive. Have powered on/off multiple times.

One of the lights in the control panel (prowash) is dimly lit. When the power is cycled, the blue \"washing\" light comes on for a few seconds then goes off. Thanks for the helpHi Sanjit,\nThank you for your question.  If the control panel is unresponsive, you will need to check both the control panel and the electronic control board to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to test the parts with a multimeter.  Here is a link to one of our videos on YouTube that you may reference on how to use one, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWC44fHn0As.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",
      "Does not heat changed element still not heatingHi Charles, thank you for your question. You may want to then double check your thermostat to see if that part is working correctly. You may also want to take a look at your wiring as well as perhaps being the issue. If those parts are fine then perhaps you may have to look into your control board being the issue. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair.",
      "Detergent door is opening late in the cycle. I think i need a replacement timer, what do you think and what part number is that?Hello Steve, thank you for your question. The most likely issue is the dispenser itself. There is a wax motor on the back of the dispenser that opens the cover to dispense the soap. This motor can malfunction and delay the opening of the dispenser cover. We would recommend replacing the dispenser itself. Part number W10861000. I hope this helps!",
      "Sometimes wash cycle works fine. Once in a while machine stops after soap dispenser opens up... on occasion draining and restarting may work...?\n\nIn your first response you mentioned first checking tstat.  I just checking and we have continuity.. What next?   Thx...Hello Anthony, thank you for asking! We would recommend checking the door latches and making sure their sound condition. A damaged latch has the potential to stop the machine mid-cycle. Given that latches are fine, check the connections in the electronic control board using a multimeter to see if any are burnt out. We hope this helps."

      "I need to know how to remove the soap cup cover.  It stopped latching after a 1 year old visited in my home.  I don't know which parts i need until i can open it and look inside.  Please let me know if i just need to exert a little more pressure or is there a trick to opening it.Hi Bonnie,\nThank you for your inquiry.  Before beginning any repair please unplug the appliance from the electrical outlet or turn the circuit breaker off.  Use a Philips head screw driver to remove the screws hold the inner panel to the door frame.  Remove the panel.  Pull out the retaining pin and use needle nose pliers to depress the tabs to detach the dispenser lever and cover. Prepare the new detergent dispenser cup cover for installation by inserting the lever.  Make sure actuator arm and spring are intact on the inner panel.  Keeping the lever aligned on the new cover and insert the lever through the panel and snap into place on the actuator arm.  Insert the retaining pin to secure the lever.  Now realign the panel in the door frame and secure with the screws.  With the repair completed, you may now either plug the dishwasher back in or turn the circuit breaker back on.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!",

      "I can't get the part number wd34x11829 to install. Help pleaseHi Holly,\nThank you for contacting us.  Before you begin any repair please unplug the appliance from the electrical outlet or turn the circuit breaker off.  To replace the control panel cover, you will need to move it a few inches away from the cabinet in order to remove the door from the dishwasher.  Use a quarter inch socket or nut driver to remove the screws from bottom access panel.  Remove the panel and any insulation you find.  Now you can determine if the water line and power line have enough slack to remove the dishwasher.  If not, you will need to shut off the water supply valve then use channel lock pliers to help unthread the water supply line fitting from the inlet valve.  Be prepared for some water to spill.  Then use nut driver to unthread the screws securing the junction box cover.  Pull the cover off.  Note the location of the wires and then untwist the wire nuts to disconnect the wires.  Unthread the strained relief nut and detach the strained relief from the junction box.  Disconnect the drain hose from the sink or garbage disposal and feed it through the cabinet.  Open the dishwasher door and remove the mounting bracket screws.  To move the dishwasher, you may have to adjust the legs so you can move the appliance.  Now move the dishwasher carefully away from the cabinet.  Unhook both door cables from the hinges.  Disconnect the door wire connector and the detach the wires from the retainer.  Now open the door and lift it up to remove it from the hinge supports.  Use the nut driver to unthread the 2 lower screws securing the hinges.  Slide the hinges out.  Now remove the upper screws securing the inner door panel to the outer door panel.  Slide the inner panel up to detach it.  If still intact lift the old control cover up and push forward to remove.  Install the new control cover by aligning the cover tabs with the slots in the inner panel then snap the cover into place.  Put the door back together and reattach it to the dishwasher.  Move the dishwasher back into place and secure it to the mounting brackets.   Adjust the levelling legs.  Reconnect the water and power lines and put access panel and insulation back in place.  Restore power to the dishwasher and everything should work for you.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"
